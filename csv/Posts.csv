Known for his mastery of the Zither— a two-stringed instrument native to the Baloch people—Ustad Noor Bakhsh has spent a lifetime nurturing and preserving Balochi folk music. His music resonates with the cultural identity of his homeland. Carrying the weight of history, tradition and personal hardship, Bakhsh has been pursuing his destined endeavor for decades. Over the years, he has captivated local and international audiences, earning him recognition as one of the foremost guardians of Balochi music. Noor Bakhsh was born in the remote, sun-drenched landscape of Pasni, a city and a fishing port in Balochistan, Pakistan. Bakhsh's early years were marked by its simplicity and hardship. Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest yet most underdeveloped province. It is home to fiercely proud people with a deep-rooted connection to their land and culture. For many like Noor Bakhsh, life in this part of the country has traditionally revolved around subsistence, with limited opportunities for education and development. Yet, amidst these challenges, the region has always been holy ground for music —a primordial 'language' through which the Baloch people express their joys, sorrows, and aspirations. From a young age, the  Pakistani virtuoso Ustad Noor Bakhsh found his solace in music. Noor spent the early part of his life as a nomadic shepherd with his musician father. He took care of his livestock and indulged in soaking musical knowledge into his soul while looking over the herd. Raised in a modest family, his environment provided little when it came to formal musical education. So instead, he was immersed in the folk traditions of his community. Growing up in this arid and secluded region sans the touch of modernity, the Balochi Benjo became his calling. Bakhsh's dedication to mastering this ancient—and now staple—instrument was unyielding, despite his adverse surroundings and the economic struggles that plagued him, his family and his people. In Balochistan's cultural heritage, the Benju is regarded as a significant instrument. Rich overtones and mesmerizing timbre of benju have become an inseparable part of the folk music in this as well as the Sindhi region. Its origin can be traced back to Japan. Historically, the benju, a key-fitted Zither, was brought to the coastal area of Baloch by Japanese sailors, as per the local lore. This instrument arrived as the taishogoto, or nagoya harp, a children’s toy. Having been nurtured in this region, it evolved into the present form with keys and a more resonant body. Bakhsh picked up benjo at the age of twelve. In the hands of a master like Ustad Noor Bakhsh, benju became an instrument of immense emotional depth and complexity. His melodies centred around themes of love, loss, and the harsh realities of rural life. What sets Bakhsh apart is his ability to infuse these age-old tunes with a modern sensibility. Those who heard him play, it was readily apparent that his talent transcended the confines of his circumstances. At the heart of Noor Bakhsh's music is a gateway to the rich cultural and historical fabric of Balochistan. In its own way, Balochi music has adopted elements from other traditions such as African percussive elements and rhythmic patterns. The ragas and talas from Sindh and Indian classical music have also seeped into the Balochi sonic palette. Bakhsh's compositions encapsulate all of these and on top of that, those draw inspiration from nature, especially birdsong—even his debut album was named after a bird. His playing is meditative and trance-inducing. With repetitive rhythmic patterns and ornamentation, he mimics the natural cadence of life in Balochistan. Ustad Noor Bakhsh's journey to becoming a globally celebrated artist was a slow, persistent climb. His prominence in the local music scene started rising, as he started performing at weddings, community gatherings, and local festivals. These performances played a pivotal role in his style and musical identity. As his reputation grew, so did the demand for his music. By the age of 15,  he began accompanying famous Baluch singer Sabzal Sami. During the 30 years of his accompaniment, he played with other vocalists and did solo shows as well. But, he did not want to stay in Quetta,Balochistan capital, and moved to a village near Pasni.In Pasni, Bakhsh  once again dedicated himself to his instrument. But, the tragic death of his wife and two young sons befell upon him.Bakhsh  pushed himself and his artistic self through this tragedy and inner turmoil. Noor Bakhsh was a local legend in his native Baluchistan for decades. Taking into account his virtuosic mastery on his instrument and Balochi music, gaining international recognition was long overdue. Eventually, it happened. Heidelberg-educated anthropologist, Daniyal Ahmed catapulted Bakhsh into the global stage. Daniyal found him through videos which have been widely circulated on social media for the past few years. Daniyal didn't have any address or exact location, yet he set out to find this artist— who has moved him with authentic Balochi music— following a few leads that he had. Daniyal was won over by Bakhsh's music and his personality. The days Daniyal spent with Bakhsh during this time was documented and released as Finding Noor.  Through that documentary, the world came to know who Ustad Noor bakhsh is. Daniyal wanted to bridge the gap between Bakhsh and audiences outside of Pakistan.  Daniyal himself said that Bakhsh's rhythmic playing is similar to West African music; moreover, the electric benju somewhat resembles an electric guitar. This led to his belief that Bakhsh's music will be accessible to global audiences. That's exactly what happened. After the release of Daniyal's video in the social media, Bakhsh and his music was featured in national and international media platforms. Eventually, in September Ahmed released his recordings in an album titled “Jingul"" and one of the tracks received critical acclaim from the U.S. music publication Pitchfork. In the following years, Bakhsh performed in Karachi, Pakistan's capital and many European countries such as Germany and Denmark with his companions Doshambay and Jamadar Guahram, with their damburag. With the release of each of the recordings of their performance on their debut European tour, Bakhsh and his musical heritage captivated the whole world. The duo even performed in the Roskilde festival, one of the largest music festivals in Europe. Ustad Noor Baksh's story will always be marked as a story of unwavering commitment to one's cultural roots. He has nurtured the rich musical traditions of Balochistan alive within himself. In doing so, he opened a gateway for a global audience. As he continues to perform and share his art with the world,  Ustad Noor Baksh remains a symbol of his tradition. His work and indomitable spirit will stand the test of time and preserve the unique heritage of Balochistan.",2024-10-11T22:38:55Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Ustad Noor Bakhsh, a name synonymous with the evocative and intricate sounds of Balochistan, has become an emblematic figure in the world of traditional Pakistani music.

He has been akin to a guiding light for his people and ""stolen generation"". There was profound personal loss in his remarkable life, but so were luminous artistic achievements. His music told his own story and how he made sense of the world around him. His soulful singing and evocative lyrics flowed from something deep within him and gave voice to the collective pain of Indigenous Australians who were removed from their families under government policies of assimilation. Early Life and the Trauma of the Stolen Generations Archie Roach was born in 1956 in Mooroopna, Victoria, to Nellie Austin and Archie Roach Sr. Both of his parents were from the Gunditjmara and Bundjalung nations. At the age of three or four, Roach was taken away from his family, along with his two sisters. This brutal act was a part of the Australian government’s assimilation policies. The aim was that these children should be assimilated into the white community and adopt the white culture at the cost of their own culture, heritage, and language. These Indigenous children were called stolen generations. It was so severe that ""The Bringing Them Home Royal Commission Report (1997)"" described such policies of removing Aboriginal children as genocide. He was taken by a Scottish white family, Alex and Dulcie Cox, who had moved to Australia from Scotland. They were told that his parents had died in a house fire. Later in his life, Roache said his adoptive parents were “blameless"" and ""were used.” He moved to Scotland and started living with the Cox family. The eldest daughter, Mary Cox, would sing church hymns and also taught Roach the basics of guitar and keyboards. His love for music was kindled right at this moment and was gradually nurtured by his foster father's love for music and record collection. He attended Strathmore North Primary School and started to sing, both in church and along with Alex Cox’s favourite Scottish tunes. He was enamored with the music of Elvis Presley, Fats Domino, and Hank Williams. The Homecoming Roach was living the happiest life possible, and everything seemed to be perfect as it was. However, at the age of 15, a letter came to his school. It was from his biological sister, Myrtle, who he thought was dead. From Myrtle's letter, he came to know his biological mother had died. His head was spinning, and his life up to that point felt meaningless to him. Roach was unable to stay in Scotland anymore, he had to find his long-lost family and his true roots. But his journey to Australia turned out to be a herculean task. In Shepparton, he was arrested and released but on the condition that he would stay there for two years, although within six months, he was on his way to Sydney. In Sydney, he was lost and lonely. But, the fate that had changed his life once played its card again, but this time it was a blessing. Purely by chance, he met his sister Diana and was able to connect to his siblings through her. Music as a Path to Healing Meeting his natural siblings should have alleviated the unsettling feeling that his life was meaningless, but these emotions lingered with him. During this period, Roach did numerous jobs but settled nowhere. Adding in the alcohol addiction, one could easily deduce that his life was in shambles. Amidst such tumultuous situations,  he met Ruby Hunter, a stolen member of the Ngarrindjeri people, whom he eventually married. They fought all the challenges together—homelessness, addiction, and the search for a stable roof. While battling these issues, Roach rediscovered his love and passion for music. He turned to it as a way of self-expression and healing. His voice became his tool for channeling his pain, his love, and his hope. In the late 1980s, Roach and Hunter formed their band, the Altogethers, along with some other Indigenous Australians, and moved to Melbourne.  Took the Children Away In 1988, Roach wrote his first song, “Took the Children Away,"" a beautiful song that tells the story of the Stolen Generations from the perspective of a child. He performed it a few times, one of which was in a concert where he opened for Australian rock singer and guitarist Paul M. Kelly. It is said his performance left the audience so stunned that they momentarily forgot to applaud.  The song later appeared on his debut album 'Charcoal Lane' (1990), which was a monumental moment in Australian music history. This album was awarded two ARIA Awards in 1991 and included in the top 50 albums for 1992 by Rolling Stone magazine.  A Guiding Light  What Roach aimed for was to shed light on the injustices the indigenous Australians faced and the incessant fear they had to ensure. Not only that, but the adverse impact of colonization was a recurring theme in his songs. Identity, loss, resilience, and everything he has been through were his inspiration. The song “Down City Streets” is about alcohol abuse; in “Walking Into Doors,” Roach wonders why men hurt their partners and explores pain and trauma. All of his songs reflected the issues Australian aboriginal communities were dealing with. Alongside the usual recording sessions and shows, he and Hunter were dedicated teachers who taught music in remote Indigenous communities. They also offered an open house to homeless and disadvantaged young people.  Roach’s work was not just about music. He was an advocate for Indigenous rights who campaigned tirelessly for the recognition of the Stolen Generations and made sure to use his platform to raise awareness. Soon, his efforts were showing results, and the historic National Apology to the Stolen Generations was delivered by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2008.   Epilogue Archie Roach died in July of 2022. He has left a towering legacy for Australians and, unarguably, for the whole world. It is impossible to think of someone who would be able to fill his shoes. Whatever happens, his legacy will inevitably endure the corrosive flow of time. His dream of hope, love, and compassion will stay relevant forever. The light bearer of freedom and his oeuvre will always be the source of strength, solace, and solidarity.",2025-03-28T16:15:28Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""wwp7e363"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""0thwj361"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_d3f516b6da8a4af287a96767749ea4a6~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1024,""height"":683}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""1isuz364"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""s82lw215"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Often referred to as \""Uncle Archie,\"" Archie Roach was one of the prominent personnel who hailed from Australia; he belongs to the upper echelon even among these figures.

When A Tunisian street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi , set himself on fire on 17 December 2010  in Sidi Bouzid , he became a catalyst for the Tunisian Revolution. The self-immolation, in response to the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official, ignited protests not only in Tunisia but across Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen , and beyond. It virtually gave rise to a wider Arab Spring against autocratic regimes. Among reverberating chants, fiery banners, and tear gas, protest music became a unifying force. It pierced through the iron wall of censorship and gave voice to the suffering and hope of oppressed Arabs; it became something that one might call “ the beat of an uprising .” Digital Amplification: Music Beyond Borders Following the advent of the internet and social media, we have lost sensitivity in many aspects of our morals and ethics. On the flip side, however, we have also achieved a way to relay our joy, happiness, and also sufferings, to the world in milliseconds, which was unthinkable a few decades ago. The Arab Spring was intertwined with social media, unlike previous protest movements. Prominent platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter worked as powerful amplifiers, which allowed protest songs to spread fast. The state-controlled broadcasters, despite their efforts, could not stop them from circulating and reaching millions overnight. Take Tunisian rapper El Général, for example. Hamada Ben Amor,  AKA El Général , uploaded a track titled “ Rais Lebled ” (lit. "" President of the Country "") in November 2010 . In this song, he did something that was considered taboo; he called out President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for corruption, brutality, and negligence of the Tunisian people. Within 24 hours, it went viral, which resulted in El Général’s arrest by Tunisian authorities. The arrest proved to be useless as the song had already done irreversible damage to the oppressive regime. It was shared so widely across Arab countries that it became an anthem of the revolution, and the Guardian referred to El Général  as “ the voice of the revolution .” Language, Identity, and Musical Diversity Protest music during the Arab Spring was constrained by genre or language. In terms of language and ethnicity, it had diverse cultural and religious identities. And in terms of genres, artists used rap, folk, rock, and pop to express what they suppressed for ages. 
 Arabic was the primary language of most songs for sure, but other languages found their relevance as well. Berber in North Africa , French in Tunisia and Algeria, and English in Egypt and Lebanon were also integral to this movement. It also explains why it was able to make a global appeal. 
 In Egypt, Ramy Essam’s “ Irhal ” (lit. “Leave”) kind of became the sound of Tahrir Square. It was more like a repetitive chant that demanded President Hosni Mubarak’s resignation. This song was unfiltered and authentic. Essam later said,“ We didn’t need a hit song. We needed our reality to be heard .” Courage and Consequence Courage has its consequences. Artists who courageously speak out face severe repercussions. Just for standing against oppressive regimes, countless musicians and artists have been exiled, imprisoned, or worse, killed. In this protest, it was no different. El Général’s  arrest lasted only a few days, but it was meant to be a warning. Ramy Essam  was also detained and tortured in 2011 , as he told Time magazine. Among these accounts, one of the most tragic stories might be that of Syrian singer Ibrahim Qashoush, who was known for chants and sarcastic songs with anti-Assad lyrics and traditional tunes. In July 2011 , his body was found in the Orontes River; his vocal cords were cut out. It did not stop the ongoing protest in any way;  instead of erasing the song, it made it sacred. As Syrian activists said,“Killing the singer made the song immortal.” The Global Stage and International Support Arab Spring protest music stirred a far too great storm to go unnoticed. It was just a matter of time for the global music and media industries to capitalize on them. Western media giants like the BBC, Al Jazeera English, and NPR highlighted the role of music in the revolutions.  Activist-musicians were invited to international festivals, and protest songs were featured in documentaries and academic studies. However, this exposure was a double-edged sword. It helped amplify the cause, but it also made artists targets for authority. Lyrics came under scrutiny and subsequently got banned or removed from platforms. The Legacy: Protest Songs After the Spring The initial wave of the Arab Spring has waned in terms of intensity, but its music is still potent and it will remain so for the coming days. In 2019 , years after the Arab Spring, Sudanese revolutionaries revived the legacy of protest songs. Artists, such as Ayman Mao, wrote music featuring lyrics that preached for unity and resistance. Apart from that, in Lebanon, another uprising in 2019 saw the resurgence of anthems like “ Thawra ” (“Revolution”) and the reappropriation of older protest songs. In Tunisia, El Général’s  music is still associated with freedom and youth activism. Likewise, during moments of political tension, Egyptian protesters are continuing to share Ramy Essam’s tracks. “The songs of the Arab Spring are our archive, even if the revolutions didn’t bring immediate democracy, the music reminds us that we tried,” said Tunisian journalist Lina Ben Mhenni.  She was internationally recognised for her work during the 2011 Tunisian revolution and in the following years, until she died in 2020 . Epilogue The Arab Spring proved that music is not a mere accessory to revolution; it is a crucial cog in the machine of revolution. Where the hand of censorship and fear has its clutch, protest songs became the tool for defying the evil grip. In the fierce lyrics and chants, or in the painful melodies of singers, the music of the Arab Spring will resonate as long as systemic oppression and dictatorship exist in our social and political paradigm.",2025-08-01T15:58:05Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""fwrlp826"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""bb6757_b611b685cfa34ebfbd62089ea8a1c224~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/gXbXn9Yclc0"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""q8kb8674"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""When revolutions were raging across the Arab world between "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""2010 "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700},{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""and "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""2012"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700},{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":"", what emerged as one of the most powerful tools of resistance was music.

She is regarded as the first Mexican woman composer to earn international attention. Many of us probably heard her melodies and lyrics sung and performed by many popular musicians from the United States and Latin America. Yet, she is one of the least-known artists who deserves global recognition and acclamation. Grever's melodies continue to captivate audiences with their poignant beauty and emotional depth. Maria Grever’s lesser-known status today can be thought of as a reflection of broader historical and cultural trends that have often marginalized significant contributions from diverse voices. This is particularly upsetting given the familiarity of her most remembered song “What a Difference a Day Made”, which, by the way, turned into a classic owing to one of the most popular and influential African American recording artists, the ""Queen of Blues"", Dinah Washington. Maria Joaquina de la Portilla Torres, known professionally as Maria Grever, was born on September 14, 1885, in León, Guanajuato, Mexico. She grew up with her Spanish father and Mexican mother. This bicultural background nurtured her lifelong ""wish to present the native rhythms and tunes from a real perspective."" From a young age, Grever exhibited an extraordinary musical talent. She composed her first piece, ""A Christmas Carol,"" at the age of four. She is said to have possessed perfect pitch, which is a rare ability to recognize pitches (as well as name and reproduce) without taking any other note as a reference. Recognizing her prodigious abilities, her parents ensured she received a formal education in music. Thus, like many other greats of the world of music, Grever had early exposure to classical music and the rich musical traditions of Mexico and Spain. At the age of six, she moved to Spain with her family. There she studied under the renowned impressionist composer Claude Debussy. Although some sources emphasize that she was self-taught on the piano for the most part, but had taken a few classes with Debussy in her later years. Whatever the case is, this was pivotal for her without a doubt, as it introduced her to European classical music and, in turn, sharpened her compositional prowess. Grever shared a deep and profound connection with her roots, so during her time in Spain she immersed herself in the traditional folk music of the region. This helped her develop a unique musical style that blended classical elements with the folkloric rhythms and melodies of Spain, and, of course, her native Mexico. Upon returning to Mexico in 1990, Grever continued her musical education. The next few years were crucial for her growth as a composer. At the age of 18, She had already written her first song, ""A Una Ola"" (To a Wave), and it sold three million copies. This is a huge feat, considering how women were underrepresented in the contemporary music scene. Maria Grever’s music predominantly features melodic richness, emotional depth, and lyrical beauty. Her compositions are often based on themes of love, longing, and nostalgia. Grever was able to convey complex emotions in her songs. Like, her biggest hit “Ti pi Tin” released in 1938 (translated into English by  Raymond Laveen). Her timeless masterpieces such as Júrame ( her first international hit), ""What A Difference A Day"" (her most recognizable composition), and many other songs bear the mark of her creativity. Grever had immaculate proficiency in the versatile repertoire. This included boleros, ballads, waltzes, and tangos. Such mastery of various musical genres was another key element that raised her music's appeal to a wide audience. Grever moved to New York following her marriage in 1916 where she was exposed to world music. Eventually, she got herself interested in Jazz and Modern Rhythms. She started absorbing what jazz had to offer to her. She realized American people didn't know much about the rich tradition of Mexico.

This country has adopted modern sensibilities only after molding them in such a way that befits its culture, tradition, and values. This was a collective endeavor for sure. However, it does not disprove the fact that some key figures stand out among others. The last Goze Haru Kobayashi is one of these outstanding figures in the Japanese Goze tradition. As one of the last surviving Goze, she represents a unique form of artistic expression and also a way of life that is tied to the socio-economic changes in Japan. Before diving into the life of Haru Kobayashi we need to look at what being a goze means. The Goze were blind women musicians who traveled across rural Japan, particularly in the regions of Niigata and Toyama, during the Edo period. They are often marginalized due to their disability. Historically, the Goze emerged from the necessity of having economic independence. Many women were forced into this profession due to societal pressures and limited opportunities. These women became adept performers of traditional music, using the shamisen—a three-stringed instrument. The Goze not only entertained but also served as preservers of oral traditions and storytelling practices through song. Haru was born in a small village in Niigata Prefecture in 1990. She was the youngest among four siblings in a relatively opulent household. She could have had a comfortable life with her family, but fate had something else planned for her. At three months of age, she lost her eyesight. There was no known way to recover her eyes. Her family feared the societal pressure that Haru have to face all her life. Two years later, her father died and her mother was unable to take care of her children. So, Haru had to be brought up by her great-uncle. Social stigma for blind people in that period jeopardized Haru's chance for a normal life in society. A blind woman could not have more than a handful of choices for her career. Haru's family decided on her becoming a goze. She was assigned to receive her training under Fuji Higuchi. Haru was given the goze name ""Sum."" Subsequently, she took her first step into the world of Goze at a young age. Her mother had always been horrified of what Haru's fate had to unfold. As a mother, she had to prepare her daughter for the harsh reality of the society. She grew progressively authoritarian to Haru. Fearing her mother's punishment, she relentlessly practiced on the shamisen, which she started learning at the age of 7, disregarding her bleeding fingers. On the banks of the Shinano River, she would practice Kangoe, a vocal style specific to goze, in thin clothes. She was cold and her throat bleeded, but Haru could not stop. Her mother showed motherly emotions to her daughter in a few instances. In one of these events, she cried after learning how Haru's friends pointed out her inability to distinguish between colors. When a goze is allowed to play duets, it symbolizes her becoming a ""true' goze. Haru became a true goze at the age of 13. But, Fuji Higuchi, was not impressed with her. She would often berate Haru for her seemingly unskilled singing. Unlike Fuji, Haru's another mentor, Sawa Hatsuji of Nagaoka, was readily captivated by her skill as a goze. In 1995, Haru cut ties with Fuji and went under the tutelage of Sawa in the goze organization of Nagaoka. She wholeheartedly praised Haru on her technique and etiquette. This nurturing environment helped her develop a deep understanding of the art form. And at the same time, she began appreciating the stories and emotions of each piece. During this period, Haru showed tremendous growth in terms of her skills, moreover, her condition was improving as well. As a result, finally, she was about to become a fully-fledged goze. After Sawa's death, Haru studied under Tsuru Sakai with whom she shared a warm friendship. Haru took over Tsuru's goze group after her retirement and stayed with her even after becoming independent. Haru announced her own retirement in 1973. She parted with her shamisen and gave it to one of her apprentices. Before her retirement, the popularity of goze was already declining l, as television was gaining its appeal in Japan. Near the end of the twentieth century, goze was going through its waning days. But, Haru still retained her popularity among the crowd. She was tailed by television reporters to a church she used to pay frequent visits to. Haru continued her work and was hopeful that this art form can find its relevance in contemporary culture in Japan. She felt that there was still a future for Goze if proper support was provided. Haru emphasized the need for awareness and education. Following her performance at Kokugakuin University in front of an audience, including the scholars of folk arts, she once again came into the limelight of the media and general masses. The education committee of Shibata city wanted  to record the goze performances. They chose Haru for this task and retired Haru resumed performing. This way goze culture was reintroduced to Japan, especially to younger generations of Japan. In 1977, she was staying in a special home for the aged, and was united with former gozes who had worked in the region. In the same year, Haru was declared as the preserver of goze activities and in 1979, she was given the ""Medal with a Yellow Ribbon,"" one of medals of honor that the Japanese government awards to the person who is hard-working and a model for the people. Haru Kobayashi’s life and work is a bridge between past and present. As one of the last Goze, she had to carry the weight of her tradition as well as embody the hope for its survival.

He was a guitarist, singer, and songwriter; a magnanimous artist in the music world, not just Zimbabwe. Across Africa and beyond, he is known affectionately as ""Tuku."" His signature husky voice and a unique blend of traditional African sounds with contemporary influences became so influential and recognizable that his music was dubbed ""Tuku Music."" In forty years of his career, as an artist and an activist, he sang of bringing in social change and embracing cultural identity. This article explores Mtukudzi's remarkable journey, his musical innovations, and the impact he had on both Zimbabwean culture and the global music landscape. Mtukudzi had a humble beginning. He was born on September 22, 1952, in Highfield, in a poor neighborhood of present-day Harare— the capital of Zimbabwe. From his early years, he was exposed to traditional Zimbabwean music, especially traditional mbira thumb-piano music and the percussive music of the Korekore people, and this laid the groundwork for his future endeavors.  In 1977, he joined the Wagon Wheels, a band where he indulged in making music with two of the most prominent musicians of Zimbabwe at that time—Thomas Mapfumo and guitarist James Chimombe. Mapfumo's moniker was ""The Lion of Zimbabwe,"" for his peerless popularity and the political influence that he achieved through his music. On the other hand, Chimombe shared the same hometown as Mtukudzi. His sincere and passionate presentation of the very essence of Shona culture earned him the epithet ""the Phil Collins of Zimbabwe.""  This band brought him immense success. Although his first song was recorded in 1975, the release of the single ""Dzandimomotera"" with this band turned into a huge hit and went gold. It spent 11 weeks as the country’s No 1. They were allowed, by an African nationalist and music promoter, to perform at the only nightclub available for blacks at the time, Club Mutanga. In addition to his work with Wagon Wheel, Mtukudzi's contribution to the supergroup Mahube — a collection of top southern African musicians and vocalists— who explored and experimented with the reinterpretation of the organic southern African styles was. Behind the curtain of these successful endeavors with these luminaries, Mtukudzi was nurturing a desire to curve his own destiny. To achieve his goal, he left the Wagon Wheel and formed the Black Spirit as a frontman. His work with this band solidified his unique style that blends traditional Zimbabwean sounds with various genres such as jazz, pop, and Afrobeat. Soon, he found a niche of his own and it became obvious what set him apart from his contemporaries. In 1978, they released Ndipeiwo Zano, their best-selling record. In this album, the South African style of mbaqanga was incorporated for the first time. Throughout his whole life, Mtukudzi always had his musical and philosophical roots in the traditions he grew up with. He sincerely believed that the traditional instruments, in no way, inferior to Western instruments like synth and organ. In his album, he started to feature traditional instruments like mbira and marimba along with his acoustic guitar on pop songs. He wanted to prove to everyone, especially to the younger generations, that on traditional instruments, pop songs can sound just as great. Mtukudzi had an eccentric approach to playing guitar. He searched for sounds that cannot be played on a guitar.  He wanted to make the guitar sound like something else, like mbira for example. He was laughed at by professional guitarists. But, Mtukudzi underscored the outcome of his quirky experimentation with guitar by pointing out the fact that he pioneered a sound that was later labeled ""Tuku music."" Mtukudzi’s signature sound,  the ""Tuku music,"" features rich melodies, intricate guitar work, and heartfelt lyrics. His music drew inspiration from the mbira, mbaqanga, traditional drumming styles of the Korekore, and modern instruments. It created a fusion that would resonate with audiences of any background. Mtukudzi’s organic and immaculate blend of traditional ways, pan-African influences, and pop forms was termed as Tuku Music. With this new distinctive ""genre"" Tuku became a household name across Southern Africa, as well as across Europe and North America. Mtukudzi always drew inspiration and themes for his music from the mundane life of the people and his own. He used to write love songs in his school days. But, with each encounter with the harsh reality of this world, he could not help writing about his experiences. Subsequently, his music superimposed people's raw and untamed desire for justice and freedom. He was unafraid to address political issues, human rights, and social justice. His words never fail to reflect the realities of life in Zimbabwe.  On ""Todii,"" he warns the communities of the insidious HIV/AIDS and at the same time urges them to sympathize with those who provide care. He had always been vehemently vocal about the injustice against women and children. For instance, in his track “Ndagarwa nhaka” listeners experience the Shona practice of marrying a widow off to the late husband’s elder or younger brother. Or in his soundtrack for Zimbabwe's highest-grossing film ""Neria,"" he portrayed the struggles of a woman in a suburb of the capital. The song “Wasakara” is an anti-establishment themed song which is speculated to be a reference to former President Robert Mugabe. After Zimbabwean independence, Mtukudzi toured across the county and advocated for tolerance and peace. Unfortunately, he never witnessed the solidarity he professed all his life. In his last album before his death, he expressed his fear for the future of his country.  Mtuzudzi was a goodwill ambassador for the UN children’s fund and was made cavaliere of the Order of Merit by the Italian government. “When I see something, I have something real to talk about. If there is something to talk about, there’s something to sing about, and there’s always something new to talk about,""  this sums up who Oliver Mtukudzi is as an artist and as a human.

These fertile geographical locations can support a bustling agriculture and economy, which inadvertently sprout the desire for a unique cultural and communal identity. What could be better than a sui generis style of music that is deeply rooted in the very essence of a community? Washed by thousands of rivers,  the vast area of the Bengal Delta is one of the most fertile regions in the world. It is home to millions of people who have lived through centuries of dynamic social, cultural, and political changes. Among the many facets of Bengal’s cultural heritage, its folk songs stand out as a powerful medium through which people have expressed their joys, sorrows, hopes, and struggles.  These diverse forms of music that arose in the delta have been deeply interwoven with the region’s history and identity. This article is all about these folk musical traditions of this region as well as the historical and cultural significance that these centuries-old melodies are nurturing. History of the Bengal Delta and Its Folk Traditions With the blessings of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers, this region has been a cradle of civilization for thousands of years. The rich agricultural land and its strategic geographical position in South Asia have made it a tantalizing place to trade goods and exchange culture. However, the history of the region is riddled with a seemingly endless chain of rulers and the foreign influences that they had brought along. From the earliest inhabitants of the Bengal Delta, the non-Aryan ethnic groups or the Austro-Asiatics, to the voracious British empire, we can find ceaseless insertions of influences from an eclectic array of cultures. The traditions we see now are, in one way or another, the amalgamation of all of these influences. So, if that's the case, what do we even mean by “folk songs” or “folk traditions?”  Redefining Musical Traditions The term 'folk song' was coined much later in the nineteenth century, but in every culture, the existence of folk songs ubiquitously precedes that of the name itself. It is undeniable that Bengali folk music is vital in representing a diverse cultural hybridization and is also closely connected to the emotion of the people as it represents the common people and incites something primitive in the inhabitants. All around the world, folk traditions of music share common characteristics. One of them is that it is composed by pastoral common people without being influenced by classical or modern music. Composed and performed by people who have little to no formal education. Folk music is an impulsive and spontaneous urge to express oneself in one's native language with simple yet memorable tunes and natural rhythms. Prominent Forms of Bengali Folk Music Bengali folk music has songs about the culture, festivals, phases of life, religion, natural beauty, rivers, and rural and riverine life. These come in numerous different forms as well. Some are sung alone while others in chorus; some are local in character, but others can be found in both Bangladesh and West Bengal. We have songs exclusive to a religious community and others that cross religious boundaries. Below, a few of the notable forms or styles or traditions are briefly discussed. Baul One of the most notable developments in Bengali folk music is the Baul tradition. The Bauls are itinerant singers and mystics, known for their simple yet profound music that mixes elements of Sufism and Vaishnavism and expresses a deep connection to the divine and the human soul. Their songs are often centered on themes of love, spirituality, and devotion. In 2005, the ""Baul tradition of Bangladesh"" was included in the list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. We have feratured (The Baul King) Baul Samrat Shah Abdul Karim. Learn more about his philosophy & profound lifestyle here . Bhawaiya Originated in Northern Bengal, there are multiple explanations of the meaning of “Bhawaiya.” These songs are characterized by a deep emotion of separation and loneliness. Buffalo keepers and cart drivers used to sing these songs during their work. For this reason, its recurring themes revolve around the ""working class"" men and their lovers. Bhatiali The Bhatiali songs are usually associated with the boatmen, known as ""Majhi,"" where “Bhata” means the low tide of any river or ocean. This folk ballad form shows a strong ecological connection since this originated from the riverine regions of Bengal. Found in both Bangladesh and West Bengal, the themes include loss, pain, memory, and the human understanding of nature.  Murshidi and Shyama Sangeet Both of these are devotional folk songs. Murshidi is associated with Sufi mysticism, whereas Shyama sangeet (“sangeet” means song in Bangla) is dedicated to the Shyama or Kali, a form of supreme Hindu goddess Durga or Parvati. Gombhira Gombhira songs are theorized to have originated from the worship of the god Shiva among the Hindu community of Malda in West Bengal, and Bangladesh, especially one of its divisions, Rajshahi, became the main center of Gombhira songs. These songs reflect on contemporary social problems through clever dialogues, songs, dances, and jokes between the maternal grandfather and grandson. Jatra Jatras (Lit. “Journey”) are usually epic plays performed in open-air arenas that are preceded by a musical concert, often lasting over an hour. The cast is predominantly male, whose members also play the female parts. Music is the central element of the jatra. Musicians sit on both sides of the stage with traditional instruments and accompany the dramatic and exaggerated gestures and dialogues. Lalon Geeti The songs composed by Bengali saint, philosopher, and social reformer Lalon Shah are called Lalon Geeti or Lalon songs. He rejected any distinction based on caste, class, and creed in his songs and mocked political identities and nationalism that divided communities and promoted violence. He influenced many prominent figures, including Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Allen Ginsberg.  Hason Raja’s Songs Hason Raja is a Bengali mystic poet who practiced Sufism. His music and life are quintessential to the development of spirituality and mysticism in Bengali folk music. Focusing on spiritual awakening and the ephemeral nature of life, his music encouraged folk singers and spiritual enthusiasts to search for divinity within themselves. Songs on Social Hierarchies and the Struggles of Life From the peasants to the intellectual elites, for anyone from every walk of life in the Bengal delta, folk music offered a path to express the deep-seated frustration, to criticize social hierarchies and injustice, to motivate and lend their shoulders for fellow countrymen. The Bauls, who adhered to an ascetic way of life, used their music to challenge established norms like rigid caste systems and the conventional religious practices of the time. Devotional songs brought everyone together in one cohesive community.  The ruling class of this region often had to ban some forms of music due to their immaculate effectiveness in binding people together against oppression. During the colonial period, folk songs became tools of resistance against British rule. Epilogue Folk music is an indispensable method of preserving personal and communal struggles, hopes, dreams, and philosophies in today’s world. This is what ties us to our roots and our identities. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the shared memory and sentiments of this region are deeply connected to these songs at a spiritual level. With the transition of Bengal into the modern era, folk music continued to adapt to urbanization and industrialization, facing the threat of extinction head-on. This is the poetic metaphor that runs parallel to the resilience of its inhabitants.",2025-04-25T15:59:02Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""6z2xl416"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_04aeaeeeea2846158d1c7f8f59f4bc23~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1024,""height"":1536},""altText"":""Bengal Delta: Folksongs & Identity""}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""xn9ty419"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""3a2u7295"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""One of the largest deltas in the world is the Bengal Delta or the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, which spans most of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal and empties into the Bay of Bengal.

In that year, General Augusto Pinochet orchestrated the military coup that overthrew democratically elected president Salvador Allende. Pinochet’s dictatorship lasted from 1973 to 1990, and these 17 long years were extremely repressive; human rights violations and widespread censorship devastated this South American country of natural wonders. In the darkest years of censorship, disappearances, and terror, art and music became key means of resistance against the regime. One such pivotal force was the Chilean band Pinochet Boys, a post-punk band whose name alone was tantamount to an act of defiance. They were, in fact, the most provocative and influential among other artists or musicians revolting against Pinochet’s rule. The name “Pinochet Boys” should be the obvious hint of that.  Through their unique sound and politically charged lyrics, Pinochet Boys resonated with Chileans and dealt a powerful blow to the throne of the oppressor. This article retraces the path they took and the relentless backlash they had from the government before being driven out of their country, and, finally, how their legacy continues in a country still healing from the scars of dictatorship. 
 The Birth of Pinochet Boys 
 Arguably, the first ever Chilean punk band formed in 1984, Pinochet Boys, was undoubtedly  an innovative and charismatic band that originated in Santiago with he line-up as follows: ●     Daniel Puente Encina–bass and vocals; ●     Iván “Vanchi” Conejeros–vocals and guitar; ●     Miguel Conejeros–keyboards, guitar; ●     Sebastian “Tan” Levine–drums. They remained active for only three years but left behind a great legacy for the later underground artists and the punk movement in South America. The band presented a mixture of punk, new wave, and techno-pop with lyrics that never shied away from pointing fingers at the usurper of Chilean power. They opted for little to no symbolism or subtlety in their music. While many musicians at the time sought to subvert the regime through more subtle means, Pinochet Boys embraced direct confrontation. Why Punk 
 The choice of “Punk” was necessitated by the sheer urgency of taking a stand with unwavering resolution for the sake of Chile’s future. In terms of music, the raw and abrasive sound of punk was an appropriate representation of the suppressed anger and rage of the Chilean people. As a form of underground music that is confrontational by nature and has a tantalizing appeal to the youth, Punk was the panacea for their social and cultural reformation. Also, the politically charged musical genre, Nueva Canción, and the New Song movement were suppressed, particularly after artists like Victor Jara were tortured and killed following the coup that ousted Salvador Allende. The clandestine nature of performing punk or post-punk made it possible to reach the people. 
 Occupational Hazard and Survival 
 “Those were extremely dark times…The fear of being detained or tortured to death was always present,” said Daniel Puente Encina. This is so macabre that each time they were on the stage, it had the potential to become their last performance. They could never finish a complete set since the police would always barge in and interrupt their covert concerts. At least one of the members of the Pinochet Boys, if not more, was injured and bleeding in every show. And that is if they were fortunate; otherwise, what awaited them was being thrown into jail. The severity of the fascist government’s effort to suppress them kept on rising, so much that on one occasion, the police tried to electrocute them after throwing buckets of water onto the stage. 
 Music as Subversive Power 
 Performing under such conditions was their way of trying to escape the reality of the dictatorship and live by making their own rules. For Pinochet boys, the notion of the protest song has always been part of their cultural DNA. When musicians, filmmakers, and writers were in a position where their work was being censored, banned, or even destroyed, Pinochet boys were there criticizing the regime at the risk of being imprisoned, tortured, or worse. The DIY approach of punk that they adopted was more than a mere musical aesthetic, rather, it was a political stance. It was their form of subversion; it was how they refused to conform to the imposed rules. If I may, I would mark it as a declaration of independence from the forces that wanted to silence them. When Less is More 
 Pinochet boys played their anti-fascist music in bars or small venues to draw as little attention from the government as possible with a surprisingly limited repertoire that could be recorded in two songs–""La música del general"" and ""Botellas Contra El Pavimento."" Each member of the band is currently living outside their country and pursuing their individual goals without the incessant fear of being shot dead. But, just a few decades ago, with only two songs, they revolutionized the idea of “Protest songs,” and that is still relevant in our current version of the earth. The Cultural Impact: More Than Just Music 
 Chile under the dictatorship of Pinochet was a nation of silent screams. Pinochet Boys are those who heard those muffled cries and vehemently broadcasted to the world. Their music wasn’t by any means for our entertainment, it was their aggressive preaching to a world that had turned its blind eye and deaf ears to the oppressed. What they established was the fact that art can resist tyranny. If not through beauty, then through the symphony of chaos. After Pinochet’s fall, Chile struggled with establishing a democratic land for its citizens as the military’s influence lingered. During that period, despite being long-disbanded, Pinochet Boys’ music stayed as a reminder of what Chile had endured.  
 Epilogue 
 The keyboardist and guitarist Miguel Conejeros published a photography book, “Pinochet Boys,” in 2008 as the editorial director, where he wrote in his prologue, “This book attempts to rescue a lost memory. A part of the unofficial cultural history of the dark 1980s in Chile.” By that time, the reason behind the band’s emergence had become something that happened in the distant past and held little influence on the world to come. Our fast-evolving society and its economy have diluted the impact and relevance of a Chilean band that was together for three years and had only two recorded songs. But the reality is that the anti-fascist band  Pinochet Boys represented a generation of young Chileans who refused to be silenced and trampled by an oppressive regime. They made music not to win the hearts of their fans, but rather to illuminate the darkest corners of Chile’s history.",2025-05-16T15:58:05Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""0i0hn606"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""64ytk604"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_3f391b129ecb4eb7b3cd76bf3a359d41~mv2.png""},""width"":274,""height"":184}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""6ntiw609"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Chile, a country with its fair share of political turbulence, witnessed a turning point in 1973.

With the influence of rock & roll and upbeat composition, pop music delivers the catchy vibe that easily resonates with any music enthusiast's mind. Nonetheless, many pop songs are written solely to dedicate to the oppressions and struggles of women. These songs inspire them to overcome the injustice and immoral norms of society and serve as the undeniable force of the feminist movement. “I Am Woman”: The Birth of a Pop Movement Pop songs have addressed issues of autonomy, freedom, self-worth, and gender inequity since the late 1960s. Helen Reddy's 1972 hit song ""I Am Woman"" is a prime example. It not only rose to the top of the charts but also conveys a powerful message of female empowerment and resilience. Its central topic is women's courage, self-awareness, and desire to resist injustice, acting as an anthem for gender equality and the burgeoning feminist movement of the time. During the 1930s and 1970s, music frequently reflected the political situation. Civil rights movements were gaining acceptance, and artists, particularly women, began utilizing their voices to question long-held standards. In such a context, Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"" evolved not as a song, but as a moment. Its lyrics— ""I am woman, hear me roar"" —encapsulated a common sentiment. Women were sick of staying silent, and now they had an anthem to shout from the rooftops. Helen Reddy entered the stage at the American Music Awards in 1972 to accept her award for Best Female Artist. Holding the microphone, she proudly thanked ""God, because She makes everything possible."" Her anthem ""I Am Woman"" had just reached number one, a milestone for a feminist song. What started as a quiet concept penned during pregnancy has grown into a global roar, booming through rallies and radios, and living rooms. Reddy's voice inspired millions, teaching that pop music could be powerful, political, and passionately feminist. Her narrative did more than just top the charts; it broke down barriers and sparked a movement that continues to thrive today. Carrying the Torch: From Madonna to Modern Icons Helen Reddy's legacy opened doors, and pop stars rushed through them. Madonna, known as the ""Queen of Reinvention,"" used her platform to challenge standards surrounding femininity, sexuality, and religion. Her 1989 single, ""Express Yourself,"" was a call to action, urging women not to accept less than they deserve. Cyndi Lauper, on the other hand, transformed ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" into more than just a party song; it was a joyful scream for autonomy and independence in a world that frequently expected women to conform. Mainstream pop is known for love stories and great choruses, but a deeper vision shows bold, enthusiastic lyrics about body confidence, independence, and self-expression. Beyoncé, Ariana Grande, and Lizzo have introduced empowerment into their music, pushing fans, particularly women, to embrace their identities without compromise. Their voices do more than just entertain; they inspire. Beyoncé's discography, for example, is filled with themes of strength, motherhood, and resilience. Through songs like ""God Is a Woman,"" Grande promotes spiritual and sexual empowerment. Lizzo's unashamed embrace of body acceptance and self-love defies stereotypes and boosts confidence in listeners from all walks of life. Fast forward, and today's pop performers are carrying on that history with vigour. Miley Cyrus explores self-expression and identity, Nicki Minaj deconstructs the double standards surrounding female sexuality, and Dua Lipa promotes confidence and personal independence through songs like ""Don't Start Now."" Feminism in Today’s Pop Culture Modern feminist pop is more than just lyrics; it's about the musicians' life, branding, and activism. Beyoncé's 2016 album Lemonade incorporated deeply personal experiences, cultural commentary, and Black feminist ideology. What was the result? A genre-defining event that resonated with women around the world. In songs like ""No Tears Left to Cry,"" Ariana Grande combines sadness, recovery, and empowerment, while Billie Eilish utilizes her platform to question expectations about how young women ""should"" behave or look. Other dynamic voices, including Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion, and Janelle Monáe, continue to redefine pop. They accommodate many body forms, sexual orientations, and cultural backgrounds. They remind us that feminism is not one-size-fits-all; it is as diverse as the women who lead it. Behind the Music: Women Taking Creative Control Feminist pop is more than just who sings the song; it's also about everyone who is involved in the production and benefits from it. Artists like Janet Jackson took issues into their own hands. Her 1986 album Control was a declaration of artistic and personal freedom. Tori Amos stepped up to write about things like sexual violence (""Me and a Gun"") and religious guilt in the 1990s, which many people still avoid discussing today. Around the same time, Alanis Morissette published Jagged Little Pill, which was filled with raw emotion, resistance, and vulnerability. Even before then, Annie Lennox was writing, performing, and producing empowering songs like ""Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves,"" which celebrated women's growing presence in music and culture. In 2019, Beyoncé became the first Black woman to headline Coachella, transforming the stage into a celebration of Black culture, feminism, and empowerment. Her Homecoming event, which featured over 100 artists and a complete marching band, was more than just a concert; it was a cultural milestone. She paid tribute to historically Black colleges, recognized female trailblazers, and reimagined what pop fame could look like. The world watched in astonishment as music met protest, art met activism. Beyoncé's performance was more than simply entertainment; it was a lesson in how a woman can dominate the world stage unabashedly on her own terms. Global Feminist Pop: Voices Around the World What began in the United States and the United Kingdom did not end there. Across Latin America, performers such as Karol G and Nathy Peluso are challenging reggaeton's typically male-dominated narrative. Karol G's ""Tusa"" encompasses despair, healing, and empowerment. Peluso's ""Business Woman"" oozes confidence and dares to occupy space unabashedly. In South Asia, singers such as Raja Kumari and Priya Ragu are combining ancient rhythms with modern beats to celebrate individuality and oppose patriarchy. Kumari's music embodies pride, perseverance, and intersectionality, whilst Ragu's sound represents the complications of being a South Asian woman traversing two cultures. In Africa, prominent voices such as Tiwa Savage and Sho Madjozi are redefining what it means to be a female musician on a continent where gender standards are strictly enforced. Final Words Feminist anthems in pop music have always been more than just great songs; they are about reclaiming space, changing narratives, and refusing to be silenced. From Helen Reddy's revolutionary roar to today's unapologetic global icons, these songs have carried generations' stories, challenges, and resilience. Moreover, as pop music evolves, so does its ability to inspire change. With every beat, chorus, and verse, one message is clear: women will continue to rise, sing, and form the soundtrack of empowerment for years.",2025-07-11T15:58:07Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""VIDEO"",""id"":""47dn81021"",""nodes"":[],""videoData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""video"":{""src"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/qT-0uamg7WE""}}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""yudj6903"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Pop music is a popular genre for expressing love, heartbreak, and emotional storytelling, especially among young generations for decades.

Super edgy lyrics, gnarly Instrumentation, and an aggressive stance against the corrupted establishment are the defining characteristics of this genre. The fascinating thing is how effortlessly punk rock was accepted, especially by the youths. Such towering success in resonating with the masses till today after its genesis in the 70s unmistakably reflects the relevance of this genre in our ever-changing society. But what is it about punk rock that makes it so powerful against the system, and why has it endured for nearly five decades? As the title suggests, this article is about the correlation between social degradation, racial discrimination, political disparity, and unforgiving punk rock. To answer these questions, we must look at the roots of punk rock, its key ideologies, and how it continues to inspire generations of individuals who feel disconnected from mainstream society. The Birth of Punk Rock The history of punk rock is one of the streams that originated from a highly influential punk subculture, which includes the history of various punk ideologies, punk visual art, punk literature, fashion, dance, and punk film. Since its emergence in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia in the mid-1970s, this subculture has spread around the globe and evolved into a plethora of different forms. If you look at the precursors and the first wave of punk in both the U.S. and the U.K., you will find why this genre became a wildfire and what kindled it. It was the growing sense of frustration with how everything around us was that is the status quo. Additionally, the unabashed glorification of ""rockstars"" in mainstream rock music or any genre in general, along with overproduced songs and perpetuation of larger-than-life ideologies, when our backyard was on fire, reeled out a direct reaction from the progenitors of punk rock. Early musicians and bands of the genre, such as the Ramones in New York and the Sex Pistols in London, played an integral role in shaping the ethos of punk. Punk stripped rock music down to its raw, rebellious roots. emphasizing short, fast-paced songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and loud, abrasive sound.  The DIY Ethos DIY (Do It Yourself) has always been central to punk rock. Disregarding the necessity of eye-catching, but ostentatious, venue, stage, lighting, and even virtuosity, punk rock bands performed in small pubs or venues where big bands would not. This DIY ethos stood in stark contrast to what was mainstream.  Rebellion Against the System In terms of lyrics, punk rock addressed issues that were often glossed over, if not ignored entirely, by mainstream media; in fact, this was the key factor that made this genre famous among the younger generations. Songs like The Clash’s “London Calling” and Dead Kennedy's “Holiday in Cambodia” tackled themes of political oppression, economic inequality, and social injustice.  Musicians fearlessly pointed fingers at the government and used music as a platform to challenge authority and provoke thought. The confrontational style packed a shockingly powerful punch. However, it was more than just for a shock value, it was a conscious attempt to decimate things that plagued our world and inspire change. Punk Rock in Social Movements Punk rock also stood against societal norms and expectations. Take punk fashion, for example; its aesthetics (ripped clothing, piercings, mohawks, etc), in contradistinction with what is considered normal, declare the rejection of conformity. Thinking for ourselves and questioning the world around us are at the core of the punk subculture. This ethos resonated with marginalized groups, including women and people of color.  The ideologies that punk rock were built upon is surely extreme, but the underlying creeds are quintessential to many other ideologies. Their movements against the system have often coincided with greater social and political movements. The anti-apartheid movement of South Africa and the anti-nuclear movement were supported by bands who advocated for peace and disarmament. Criticism Punk rock has faced numerous criticisms from critics and fans. It is not true for every punk rock band, but the ""do it yourself"" approach has had many bands delve too much into the raw and rebellious sound at the cost of intricacies that usually make music more interesting. Distortion-imbued raging power chords and fast tempo render their music monotonous and amateurish. A complex and global underground of punks think of anarchism as a proper political ideology, they are sometimes called ""peace punks"" or ""anarcho-punks. They were called on their actions of creating chaos just for the sake of it. These accusations were brought against some punk rock bands as well. Some of them adhere to the belief that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change. It is no wonder that punk had many raise their eyebrows at it.   It has also been criticized that the recurring themes of decay, despair, suicide, and social breakdown, as well as the unrestrained emphasis on these, evidentially point toward the nihilism of punk rock. This genre has always aimed at the disillusionment of people. But if the true or, at the very least, better alternative is not presented, such disillusionment is not that useful.  The Legacy of Punk Rock We cannot help but admit that the genre’s DIY ethos has inspired countless musicians, artists, and activists to create their own spaces and paths. Punk rock has taught us to challenge the status quo and not to take the apparent peace granted. Punk rock’s emphasis on individuality and nonconformity is still relevant today. And it would certainly continue to encourage those who feel alienated or oppressed by societal norms. Questioning authority, resisting oppression, and fighting for a better world are still alive in many other genres, and in many ways, it is due to punk rock. From grunge to hip-hop, it has a far-reaching impact. Artists like Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, and Run the Jewels have drawn inspiration from punk and channeled its spirit through their music. Epilogue  Punk rock’s legacy lives on, and it will live on for centuries to come. It is not confined within the boundary of music anymore, its influence has reached across the broader cultural and political landscape as well. At its core, this genre is more about individualism and self-expression. As long as there are imbalances in the power structure in our world, punk culture will be waging war against it. Until the day when humanity attains the proper peace and harmony, punk rock will remain as a symbol of resistance and resilience.",2025-04-11T15:59:03Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""cv7gq1033"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_582f38ee73f04d498d28d4ebce771572~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1280,""height"":852}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""smezz1036"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""yddp12469"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Punk rock is one of the most popular and unorthodox genres of the twentieth century.

This could not be further from the truth; historically, it has been a tool for protest and political mobilization.  Rooted in mostly oral traditions, folk songs have narrated histories that were often unwritten, including the grievances of the working class, the pain of war, and resistance to social injustice. Across the 20th and 21st centuries, protest music in the folk tradition has been in line with shifting political consciousness. From labor struggles to civil rights, feminism to climate action, folk protest music has evolved with the spinning wheel of cultural and political sensibility while staying true to its roots. The Origins: Labor, Class, and Early Political Songs In the early 20th century, from the 1900s to the 1940s, the industrialization of the United States ushered in an era of promises and prosperity. But, proving the saying that “there is always a shadow beneath a lamp,” it also gave rise to unprecedented imbalances and inequalities in our social and economic structures. This new era saw the rise of powerful labor movements due to unsafe working conditions, regression, and many more cracks that were appearing in our docile society. What came hand in hand with these protests was the emergence of protest folk songs. These became indispensable tools for solidarity and compassion among working-class communities. The famous “Industrial Workers of the World (IWW),” also known as the Wobblies, is a global labor union that was founded in 1905 in Chicago. Known for its radical but inclusive approach, they advocated for the rights of all workers regardless of skill, race, gender, or origin. They used music as a tool to communicate with workers. As the workers were mostly illiterate, it was an effective method to unite the masses.  The interesting thing about the IWW is their book  “Little Red Songbook” (1909), which is a collection of songs. The songs were composed using known melodies with new radical lyrics. It made them easy to remember and perform in union halls or rallies, or on picket lines. One of the famous martyrs of the movement was folk artist Joe Hill, whose execution in 1915 turned him into a symbol of resistance. His most famous song would be “The Preacher and the Slave,” which ridiculed capitalist promises of ""pie in the sky,"" a term coined by Joe Hill himself. During the Great Depression, the role of folk as the music of survival was being cemented, and Woody Guthrie would perhaps be the most symbolic folk voice of the 1930s and ’40s. His music was able to capture the despair of Dust Bowl migrants. Not only that, the broader discontent with voracious capitalism was also palpable in his music. The 1960s: Protest Folk at the Heart of Culture The 1960s represented a critical turning point. On our way to the modern era, this was the golden period of folk music. It was during this period that folk became both the soundtrack and an active catalyst of revolutions. And no other figure was more influential than Bob Dylan.  He drew from Guthrie and blues traditions and offered his audiences his criticism of war, racial injustice, and generational divides in his own poetic way. Listening to Dylan's songs, such as “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” and “Masters of War,” reveals how his music went way beyond simple protest. They invoked systemic criticism.  However, Dylan did not want to remain and be labeled as a “protest singer,” and went electric at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. It was his signal, or even warning, to his audience that a transformation is ensuing. His move was controversial for sure, but this very move turned his music into protest art from protest music. Folk Decline and Genre Hybridization After the 1960s, protest folk songs somewhat retreated from the cultural forefront. It was partly due to the invasive commercialization of music. The ongoing fragmentation of activists and their movements was also responsible for such fallout. With the end of the gruesome Vietnam War, public disillusionment with institutional politics changed many things. Also, the steep rise of disco and punk took their place, rightfully so, in the pantheon of genres of protest music. Still, protest folk had a long way to go before becoming obsolete, but it survived in hybrid forms. Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen, and others incorporated folk storytelling into rock. In this interpretation of folk, class struggle and disempowerment played a central role as well. Meanwhile, Ani DiFranco revived the early folk with sharp feminist themes. With her own label, she became an icon of third-wave feminism as well as independent artistry.  Digital Folk and Decentralized Protest In the 2000s and 2010s, folk-infused protest music reemerged but in an entirely new form and context. Artists like Hozier brought moral critiques of religion, homophobia, and colonialism into mainstream pop, which is not only unheard of but also quite extreme. He did this through folk structures and gospel influence. “Take Me to Church” became a viral anthem for LGBTQ+ rights. Meanwhile, Rhiannon Giddens found a way to reconnect folk music to its Black and Indigenous roots. She corrected the misconception that folk is a white genre, which is a huge feat. Her reinterpretations of  “slave songs” and “minstrel tunes” are laudable since they created a bridge that would bring the past to modern justice. Today, Folk protest music is way less centralized, so much so that perhaps it is more democratic. The genre has fragmented into “micro-genres” with different and distinct paths to follow. Yet, what unites all of these is the intent — protest, witness, and critique. A TikTok snippet can now reach millions overnight, achieving the same consciousness-raising impact that once required a concert hall or protest rally. Final Words Historically, folk has always been present in protest songs in one way or another. Folk protest music has reflected and responded to the political landscape of its time. How it evolved from union halls to digital platforms illustrates its adaptability. From labor to liberation, civil rights to climate justice, this genre has remained a witness to collective struggles that changed its tone and platform, but stayed consistent in spirit.",2025-07-18T15:58:05Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""pk92n466"",""nodes"":[],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""VIDEO"",""id"":""ha9ud776"",""nodes"":[],""videoData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""video"":{""src"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/mPSjg5IIbrs""}}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""vs73i779"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""\n"",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Folk music subscribes to the philosophy that embraces nature and authenticity, and it is not uncommon for folk traditions to be associated with rural, rustic, or grassroots forms of art.

The soft, somber, and melancholic music that people cherished and loved in the 1800s was no longer viable. To march the troops on the frontline, to strengthen their bond with their comrades, and to keep them motivated away from home, it demanded a different sort of music. And hence, amongst silence and bombs of war, came the birth of a new song! The Musical Revolution During The World Wars Before the devastating World Wars, classical music and folk music dominated the musical landscape, surpassing all other genres. However, as the war loomed closer, it became apparent that to motivate both the soldiers and common folks. During the time of war, a different approach to music was needed. The Birth Of Patriotic Songs Artists all around the world figured out the appeal of more energetic and patriotic songs during the time of war. Long gone are the days of folk music, during the time of despair, patriotic music is what moved and motivated soldiers to march even to their certain deaths. A few examples of such emotionally driven patriotic music of the World Wars were:  “We Will Meet Again” by Vera Lynn “Imagine Me On The Maginot Line” by George Formby “Kiss Me Goodnight, Sergeant Major” by Arthur Askey “As Time Goes By” by Dooley Wilson Government Investment In The Shift Of the Music Industry As the governments of the conflicted countries soon figured out that patriotic music is helping their soldiers to march despite homesickness. It helps them to sleep despite being afraid to die in their sleep. The government bodies soon started funding artists to make more emotionally expressive songs that would boost the soldiers' morale when on the battlefield. The Exile Of Avant-Garde Artists And Jewish Artists With the shifting tide of the music industry during the World Wars, both the Avant-Garde and the Jewish artists couldn’t quite adapt to the changes. From soft, somber, and soothing folk music to expressive, vigorous, and chivalrous songs was a huge jump in genre that was hard to adapt to. However, the exile of these artists happened due to both the rapid change of the music industry and the shift in world politics. As Nazism grew stronger across Europe, jews were either fleeing the lands or begin prosecuted. Avant-garde artists, on the other hand, were deemed to be politically hindering due to their strong style of lyricism. Hence, along with Jewish artists, avant-garde composers were also prosecuted and their access to the general public through radio and such was reduced. The Rise Of Jazz And Swing Music During The World Wars Not much other genres flourished during the World Wars other than patriotic music, except, of course, “Jazz” and “Swing” music. In war, soldiers experienced a rollercoaster of emotions. From feeling homesick to being demotivated to even being distressed as the war dragged on. The emotionally driven patriotic music did serve its purpose. When soldiers lost all hope and motivation during the days of war as it kept prolonging, such music drove them beyond their limits and helped them march on. However, on the other hand, the soldiers needed to relax and sleep, and remove all the stress they had endured on the battlefield. That is how Jazz and Swing music came in handy. Originating in the early 1900s, jazz music was the perfect mixture of African-American music traditions. They combined the vibes of ragtime, blues, and some European folk music to achieve a perfect blend of harmony. Generally, aimed to be ambiguous and fun to listen to, helping the soldiers on the battlefield to find some ease and enjoyment during the time of war. Swing Music is generally a subcategory of jazz music; however, it is also pretty distinct! Swing music during the early 1900s was aimed to be much like jazz. Fun and relaxing, unconventional lyricism, and rapid innovation were what comprised swing music. The lyricism especially differed a lot from jazz music during the World Wars. Swing music was a vibrant substitute for patriotic music around that time; the lyricism of swing music was generally focused on being engaging and morale boosting for soldiers on the battlefield, while also being vibrant and enjoyable to the ears to relieve them. The Music Industry After The War After 2 hard-fought World Wars, we finally achieved a lasting peace. During the time of the war, the governmental bodies across the globe greatly funded to promote artists who were responsible for the composition of emotionally raw patriotic music. And it was well received by both the soldiers on the battlefield and the general public. Although other variations were also introduced in that period, such as Jazz and Swing music, they were also equally loved by the common public as they were by the veterans. Hence, the music industry didn't just take a turn during the war; rather, it was changed and altered completely, and a new era was ushered in. Technological advancements like radio and the selling of physical copies of records accelerated the growth of these newfound genres of music. In the early days, to become a prominent genre in the world of music, it needed time. However, with such technological advancements, the newly formed genres reached across the globe, door to door, in a matter of a few years. Although patriotic music in general faded away after the time of war, Jazz became a prominent genre in the history of music and is still going strong today! Final Words The two great World Wars surely did change a lot about human civilisation. From changing how we view the world to the entire global infrastructure and economy. In the meantime, it also posed a great change in the music industry. It gave rise to “Patriotic Music” and subsequently to “Jazz” and “Swing” as already discussed. Although two of the genres didn’t find much traction afterwards, Jazz music is still going strong. Music in every era conveys the message of the general people. In the 1900s, it was the message of war, struggle, ptsd, chaos, and of death. It gave birth to new ideas, genres, and artists that inspired generations after to pursue music and make the industry what it is today.",2025-06-27T15:58:05Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""VIDEO"",""id"":""duggo1174"",""nodes"":[],""videoData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""video"":{""src"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/Z2lkXc-hRGY""},""duration"":132}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""xf9dn1079"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The World Wars took their toll not only on millions of lives and the entire civilisation of the world, but also on the entirety of music across the globe.

It is the ubiquitous manifestation of the culture we intend to build, the passion we have for ourselves and others, and also the yearning to express oneself, or lack thereof. But in the whirlwind of the 21st century, the tapestry of artistry, particularly in music, has undergone a paradigm shift, which is quite a dramatic one if I may say so. In the past couple of decades, advancements in technology have reshaped industries, businesses, and human behavior in nearly every aspect that we can imagine. Being a musician today entails way more than being good with your voice or your instrument of choice; it means navigating an ever-changing labyrinth of platforms, algorithms, branding, and economic uncertainty. The question that lingers in the minds of both aspiring and established musicians is simple and profound yet terrifying: “Is it still worth it?” To understand the complexities of being a musician in the 21st century is to know how the music scene has evolved over the past decades, the financial and creative challenges musicians face, and whether there is still something organic beneath the digital skin of modern music. The Changing Landscape of the Music Industry The Fall of the Traditional Music Industry Two decades ago, success in music was intimately connected to record deals, physical album sales, radio play, and so on. The Major labels dictated what reached the masses, and artists’ careers were inadvertently curved by contracts under such labels. Now, this model is on the verge of becoming obsolete. The rise of digital platforms has somewhat evened out access to music for musicians and audiences alike. Following “Napster” in the early 2000s came iTunes, and then the floodgates opened for platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and TikTok. This opening of the floodgate ushered in the era of “streaming culture.” Streaming Culture and Shortened Attention Spans Now, artists can upload tracks from their bedrooms and reach global audiences from their own beds. Such utopian freedom does come with new challenges. Streaming services, while allowing for wide distribution, reduce the value of individual songs. A stream on, say, Spotify earns an artist a mere fraction of a cent. Today, music is something that we “consume,” and most musicians who want to be “successful” are aware of that. So, their music is shaped less by artistic exploration and more by what captures attention quickly. The rise of TikTok has accelerated this, with many songs gaining popularity because of 15-second snippets. These transitions happened really fast and are here to stay, as it seems. So, there has to be an enabler, right? The Algorithm Era Today’s music scene is dominated by a double-edged sword called algorithms. Lesser-known or unknown artists can ""blow up"" overnight, but it makes the playing field not truly level. Spotify and YouTube push content based on consumers’ behavior and trends. Musicians are often forced to optimize titles, thumbnails, hashtags, and even songwriting structures to appease the algorithmic lords. Isn't it natural to wonder whether a modern musician is still an artist, or a glorified content creator? The Financial Struggles of 21st Century Musicians You might ask, “So what? If musicians can live off of these platforms and there are people who would appreciate their effort, it’s not that bad, is it?” Yeah. But, the thing is… Streaming doesn’t pay enough–plain and simple. Okay, let me rephrase that: “Streaming doesn’t pay enough for everyone.” Among millions of musicians, a select few artists—Taylor Swift, Drake, Ed Sheeran—enjoy global stardom and financial abundance. How do you think the vast majority of musicians are doing financially? Income from physical records is about to vanish, and touring is expensive and grueling. Without relying on side jobs, how will they pay the bills? Artists who used to make a modest but sustainable income through record sales and live shows, the “middle class” of music, have fallen off the wagon, and we didn't notice! Debt, Burnout, and Sacrifice Pursuing a music career is stressful and consumes a substantial amount of resources—money and time. It also involves significant investment in gear, recording, promotion, etc. It is not uncommon for artists to go into debt. Burnout, anxiety, depression and health struggles make it even harder to achieve success. The Passion That Keeps Artists Going The notion of “starving for art” has become an insensitive romanticism. The pressure to maintain an online presence, release content frequently, and engage audiences is relentless. Yet artists persist. Why?  For many, music is not a choice but a compulsion. The act of creation, the connection with audiences, the euphoria of performing on stage—these are deeply fulfilling and cathartic. Musicians find themselves and their sense of purpose during the creative processes of writing, recording, and performing music, even if their bank accounts paint very different pictures. Is Music Still a Creative Endeavor? In music, or any social media platform, to be successful is to go viral. Artists structure songs with catchy rhythms and “hooks” and follow trending sounds. Of course, creativity is involved in how to utilize these tools, however, sadly, it shifts the focus from the neoclassical motto “art for art's sake” to a post-modern one, “art for algorithm's sake.” When an artist writes a song based on what’s trending rather than what they feel, doesn't it raise concerns about authenticity? Some artists now use data analytics to decide what kind of music to make. The choice of genres, tempos, and lyrics—all are based on what’s more likely to go viral. At this point, I think I should clarify that many artists have found a way to blend technology and creativity, and we do see the rise of bedroom producers, indie artists, and experimental musicians whose work is exciting, highly anticipated, and praised for being exceptionally creative. However, there is a common practice of writing songs based on what’s trending rather than what the musician feels, and we cannot call these creative acts; rather, this is just creating content. Redefining Success The music world used to measure “success” by record sales, radio hits, and the number of awards. Now, it is more about the number of monthly Spotify listeners, social media followers, or YouTube views. But in both cases, these numbers don’t always reflect artistic impact, integrity, or ingenuity. Now, artists can redefine success on their own terms. For some, it’s about building a sustainable fan base and living modestly through their music. They can create small but devoted fan bases and find their niche. They can also use the platforms to engage directly with their community. For others, it’s more pushing artistic boundaries or creating music that holds meaning to them. They are concerned less about “monthly listeners” and more about overcoming their own self as a musician. Both of these are equally right paths to walk on. As an artist, you can hop on any one of these boats as long as it nurtures the creative “sapling” inside you. Epilogue: Is It Still Worth It? So, what's the verdict? Is being a musician in the 21st century still worth it? It might depend on how you define ""worth.""

Unbound by the limitations of time or space, it was designed to reestablish and reimagine the spiritual depth of South Asian  classical music.  An even more unique fact associated with this instrument is that there is only one performer in the world, Noor Zehra Kazim , daughter of the visionary thinker and lawyer Raza Kazim , who is the inventor of this instrument. This is an article on a father-daughter duo who have developed a rare musical legacy that is an immaculate bridge between innovation and tradition, sound and silence, east and west. Origins: An Intellectual and Artistic Quest The story of the Sagar Veena  begins in the mind of Raza Kazim , a lawyer, philosopher, politician, and polymath. He was one of the prominent political figures in Pakistan ’s early days. However, as he grew more and more disillusioned with politics, he progressively became a dissident thinker. In the 1970s, this disillusionment is what eventually made Kazim  turn his attention to other things he was drawn to; one of those was music. Through his research on how instruments across cultures are built, tuned, and heard, he realized the instruments of South Asia  are becoming too mechanical and homogeneous despite having such a rich culture to draw from. At this moment, he began to form the concept of an instrument that would inherit the subtlety of ancient veenas  and at the same time, it would be compatible with the modern sensibility of North Indian  classical music (NICM). A New Voice for an Ancient Tradition. The name is divided into two parts; “ Sagar ” is a Sanskrit word for ocean, and “ Veena ”is a generic term used to classify the family of stringed instruments which closely resemble lutes. It is the outcome of dynamic experimentations carried out by Raza since 1970 with the cooperation of his daughter, Noor Zehra , in practically testing the potential of the instrument as a serious musician. Veenas can be both fretted and fretless. The Sagar Veena  is fretless, which allows for a fluidity of sound that enables the performer to explore microtonal slides and intricate ornamentations. Sagar Veena  has two gourds, and this is quite a departure from all existing stringed instruments of NICM, in all respects. In the Sagar Veena , the main players are not the obvious, tangible, or measurable aspects of sound–the pitch or the volume, for example—but rather the intangible characteristics such as timbres, resonances, and harmonics, and a wide range of them. Noor  shared in an interview, ""The aim was to create an instrument that could explore the tonal subtleties lost over centuries. The sound had to be intimate, deeply personal, and spiritually invoking."" The Lone Performer: Noor Zehra Kazim ""When I began playing the Sagar Veena, it wasn’t just about learning an instrument—it was about learning how to listen in a different way” — Noor Zehra Kazim Noor Zehra Kazim  was surrounded by philosophy, literature, and the arts from a young age. But it was music that enchanted her the most. Kazim then went to Berkeley, California in the US, and there she studied at the “ Ali Akbar College of Music .” She learned under Ustad Shareef Khan Poonchwala  for a few years in Pakistan , and she became well known as the only Veena player of Pakistan . Noor Zehra  has played the Sagar Veena  for countless audiences, and has even travelled to Japan and Norway for performances. Being the only player of an instrument entails both immense responsibility and artistic solitude. Unlike other instrumentalists, she does not have any legacy of recordings to learn from and no master to correct her form. Every raga she performs is shaped through intuition, long hours of practice, and her own evolving understanding of sound. Not Just an Instrument—A Philosophy “In a way, the Sagar Veena plays me.” — Noor Zehra Kazim 				 The Sagar Veena  is built on the philosophy of listening and composing. It holds a significant place in a broader intellectual movement fostered by Raza Kazim  through his Sanjan Nagar Institute of Philosophy and Arts (SNIPA) .  Sagar Veena  stands for the research in sound, music theory, and aesthetics, concepts that are central to SNIPA ’s creed. Sagar Veena is not merely played; it is rethought constantly. Noor Zehra ’s involvement in this is more like a researcher. She records her sessions, analyzes, and often reconfigures her own playing techniques. In fact, more than seventeen Sagar Veenas have been made since its inception. Why Does It Matter? Sagar Veena  goes against commercialization and dwells in obscurity. These two factors make Sagar Veena  an outcast yet unique instrument, especially for not entertaining the race of mass production, both in form and philosophy.  A profound effect is how it invites to redefine what it means to be a musician. For Noor Zehra , being a musician is not about display or virtuosity, but about being a channel through which the sound can travel. Looking Ahead: Will the Sagar Veena Survive? “What happens when Noor Zehra  stops playing?” is a natural question that can pop up in anyone's head. The truth is, so far, no new performer has emerged. Which is understandable since the technique is complex, the training demanding, and the path too isolated for many. Both Noor  and Raza Kazim  are not concerned with such poignant speculations. To them, what matters is not permanence, but the kind of listening it enables. Epilogue: A Sound Beyond Time “The Sagar Veena is not a loud instrument, but it speaks volumes.” In our noisy world, the Sagar Veena  is a whisper that is impossible to ignore. It is music not just for the ears, but for the soul. It forces the listeners to pause, to reflect, and to hear again what they often forget. The history that the Sagar Veena  shoulders is of solitude, invention, and authenticity. We might not witness anyone taking up the Sagar Veena  after Noor Zehra , and it would not even matter. What Noor  is leaving behind has the potential to sprout into something more valuable and significant; that is the true legacy of Sagar Veena.",2025-08-15T16:00:15Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""jvwu91251"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_821c6ddbe0f2456580accc342c232bda~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/xE06s9zRE8Y"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""atf1i1254"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""9q6jx1267"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""jur6e1269"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""On a quiet afternoon, if anyone strolls through the corridors of "",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Lahore’s Sanjan Nagar Institute of Philosophy and Arts,"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":"" they might come across something remarkable; something that is both modern and ancient at the same time; something that can create extraordinarily delicate and flowing sounds.

From somniferous lullabies...",5,[],FALSE,blues-jazz-and-the-roots-of-black-resistance,,"Music has been a vehicle for our individual and collective expression of joy, grief, rage, and even defiance. From somniferous lullabies to thunderous battle cries against oppression, music flows through the veins of our very existence. Such metaphors do bear the risk of sounding too abstract, however, the genesis and evolution of blues and jazz, as musical genres, paint a different picture. Blues and jazz are way more than forms of mere entertainment. They powerfully symbolize cultural tenacity, as both genres emerged from the struggles and experiences of African Americans and reflect the history of slavery as well as segregation. This article explores how blues and jazz contributed to the roots of Black resistance and offered a means of escape and self-expression. The Birth of Blues: A Sound Born from Struggle Blues is deeply intertwined with the experiences of Black Americans, particularly in the South. The origin can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, during the enslavement of Africans. Most of the blues musicians had predecessors from Africa who were brought to America in the slave trade and were forced to work on plantations in the southern states of America, and factories in the northern ones. Many of the best-known blues musicians were from the South, and for this reason, it is argued that the Mississippi Delta was the birthplace of the blues.  In his book ""The History of Jazz,"" music historian Ted Gioia writes, ""Blues was a way for African Americans to express their pain and frustrations in a world that often ignored their humanity.""  The distinctive use of the 12-bar structure and “blue notes” carry the emotional weight of the genre and the lyrics dealt with personal and societal hardships, such as love, betrayal, poverty, and injustice. Blues singers like Bessie Smith, Robert Johnson, and Muddy Waters were not only skilled musicians but also remarkable storytellers who documented the realities of Black life in a segregated America. In a broader sense, blues was tantamount to a passive resistance. Jazz: The Soundtrack of Black Liberation Another crucial form of Black resistance jazz emerged from ragtime, blues, and other musical influences such as European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, and work songs with a bigger ensemble of instruments. It developed in the early 20th century in New Orleans before spreading across the country. Being nurtured in the multicultural setting of New Orleans and a blend of a multitude of familiar and famous genres, it was the first true American genre that achieved global recognition. Jazz was a more improvisational form of protest in contrast to blues, where the latter was often focused more on personal expression of pain and survival. A myriad of subgenres were developed over the following decades after its inception ( Kansas City jazz, gypsy jazz, bebop, modal jazz, and free jazz, for example), and all these eventually led to jazz fusion and Afro-Cuban jazz. By the mid-20th century, jazz had become way more inclusive than anyone could have ever imagined. Jazz stands as a stark contrast to the structured forms of Western music with its improvisation as a form of self-expression. In one way,  improvisation can be seen as a metaphor for Black resistance. In the 1920s, during the Harlem Renaissance, jazz became a symbol of Black intellectual and cultural empowerment. Figures like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Billie Holiday used jazz to convey both personal and collective experiences. Blues, Jazz, and Resistance to White Supremacy Martin Luther King Jr. said that “jazz speaks for life. The blues tells the story of life’s difficulties…This is triumphant music.” Black people were marginalized and dehumanized by the society which was dominated by white people. Both blues and jazz were the counterpoints to the narratives of white supremacy. These provided a pathway to reclaim their humanity and burst out of the racist structures that were there to limit their opportunities. One among many bold ways in which blues and jazz musicians upheld their resistance was through their presence in the entertainment industry. The early 20th century was a time when Black artists were often downplayed for their ""race music."" It was a way of keeping them and their art away from mainstream media. However, jazz greats like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington severed these barriers by their musical genius, and also by the cultural significance they had at that time. Of course, this was not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. According to biographer Allan Keiler, contralto Marian Anderson was invited to sing in Washington by Howard University as part of its concert series due to her international reputation. But the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), a lineage-based membership service organization for women,  owned the hall and they refused to allow her to use the hall because she was black. Moreover, there was a white-artist-only clause printed in every contract issued by the DAR. Moreover, both blues and jazz had strong ties to the civil rights struggles of the 20th century. Artists like Nina Simone, John Coltrane, and Sam Cooke used their music and voiced the demands for equality, justice, and freedom. Nina Simone's ""Mississippi Goddam"" was her ""first civil rights song"" which was banned in several Southern states. Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" is another example of how music serves as a much needed tool for protest and activism. Such revolutionary songs had directly addressed the frustrations and hopes of the Civil Rights movement. The Enduring Legacy of Blues and Jazz in Black Resistance The search for identity among African Americans was taken upon by Jazz musicians before any modern essayists and scholars wrote the racial identity as a problem. Today, blues and jazz continue to remind us of the unabated and ongoing struggle for racial justice and freedom. It can be said without a doubt that the civil rights movement achieved significant victories. However, the cessation of systemic racism still remains elusive in many aspects of society. In the 21st century, blues and jazz have morphed into something more complex and widespread yet they retain the essence of their true purpose. On top of that, genres like hip-hop have inherited this raging desire of liberation from blues and jazz aiding in the pursuit of pushing the boundaries of Black artistic expression and social commentary.  Final Words I cannot imagine a future where music has ceased to play a crucial role in resistance movements. Blues, jazz, or anything derived from these will serve as integral cogs that run the story of Black resistance forward. These genres will continue to inspire and influence artists today as beacons of hope and courage and signify that the ongoing struggle for freedom shall be fought with music.",2025-01-31T23:51:36Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Music has been a vehicle for our individual and collective expression of joy, grief, rage, and even defiance.

It is supposed to be a place where voices are meant to be muffled. However, if anything, humans have always been persistent and unstoppable, just like the plants that grow from the crevices of the dry and lifeless concrete walls of our cities. In such hellish conditions of prison, people have often found their solace in music. Music has emerged time and again not only as a weapon of resistance, but as a sanctuary of the soul, and a bridge to the outside world as well. From the torturous dungeons of Chile to the isolation cells of apartheid South Africa , music created by, or about, political prisoners has traveled past the barbed wires and high concrete walls to comfort the oppressed and encourage them to put up a resistance. This article is all about those musicians who created so me of their masterpieces in prison and immortalized themselves in the history of mankind. The Power of Music in Captivity “ Music can function as a political archive—especially in contexts where official histories are erased. In prison, a song becomes both testimony and lifeline. ”  — Ethnomusicologist Dr. Angela Impey. For political prisoners, music often proves to be way more than an art form—it literally becomes a survival tool. Locked up for their activism driven by their beliefs, or associations to a particular group, these “ prisoners ” masterfully turned to melody and lyrics to preserve and commemorate memory, somewhat incorrigible dignity, and confront psychological isolation.  In a place where people are monitored, censored, and controlled by unfair and unjust rules of tyrants, music offers a cryptic and emotional path of communication without ever failing. There is something in rhythms, harmony , and melody that can carry messages that speak of forbidden truths. Icons of Resistance: Artists Who Turned Captivity into Song Countless individuals have transformed their prison experiences into something that can be described aptly as their “ musical legacies .” Some world-renowned, and others were known mainly within their movements. But, regardless of what they were, the music they composed went on outlasting their confinement and, in many instances, their lives. What matters are the contexts, incarcerated musicians and activists have always redefined what it means to sing behind bars.  The 1970s were a turbulent and fateful year for Chile when political singers had long been struggling against dictatorship and repression. During this decade, it saw numerous artists getting arrested, tortured, or even exiled. One of the most iconic examples is Victor Jara , who was a Chilean folk singer and theatre director. Jara was known for his haunting lyrics and unwavering politics which, by the way, made him a symbol of resistance. Jara was arrested and eventually murdered for supporting President Salvador Allende  following the 1973 military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. His death made him a martyr. He was shot more than 40 times by Pinochet's U.S.-funded forces; however, the final lines that he wrote were. “ What horror the face of fascism creates, To carry out their plans They use knives and guns .” In the post-colonial period of Africa, music became the weapon of resistance. The musicians faced incessant harassment and imprisonment for speaking against authoritarianism and corruption. Artists did not have any choice but to embody protest itself.  Most notable among them was Nigerian artist Fela Kuti,  the pioneer of Afrobeat . For him, music was both shield and sword. Fela was frequently jailed, most notably in 1984 under Muhammadu Buhari’s regime, on dubious currency-smuggling charges. Yet even in confinement, he was as defiant as ever. He didn’t waver or falter. Fela once declared:  “ Music is the weapon. Music is the weapon of the future .” In these stories, and thousands of others, a common theme can be outlined, and that is “how prison sharpened the music’s urgency and deepened its emotional resonance.” Whether performed from memory or smuggled out on scraps of paper, their compositions served as both documentation and defiance, challenging the state’s attempt to erase their voices. Music as Global Solidarity “ Sometimes the drumbeat of freedom is louder when it’s played far away from the prison gates.” — Professor Veit Erlmann From Woody Guthrie  to Rage Against the Machine, from Bob Marley  to Manu Chao , countless musicians have covered or referenced songs by political prisoners. Were those homages to the unyielding spirit of protestor musicians? Of course. But the act is more than homage, something with a much deeper shade of significance. It exemplifies how heavy prison-composed music is emotionally connected and that it often extends beyond national boundaries. One example is the “ Free Nelson Mandela ” song by The Specials in 1984 . It wasn’t just a catchy tune—it became a tool against apartheid. The international pressure it exerted was unimaginable, and it contributed to the growing global campaign.  Similarly, Bob Dylan’s  “Hurricane” about Rubin “ Hurricane ” Carter (a boxer wrongfully imprisoned) brought public attention to the case, helping pave the way for Carter’s eventual release. Protest songs from prisons often have the power to make an individual into a symbol for the masses. In Myanmar, after the 2021 military coup, imprisoned artists and poets, some of them as young as 17 , used social media and encrypted apps. These apps circulated chants and verses and gained global support in favor of them. This is now called the “ Spring Revolution Soundtrack ” by many. These songs are not just protest—they are cultural memories in motion. Epilogue: Closing the Cell Door, Opening the World When oppressive regimes imprison artists and activists, what they truly aim for is silence. They would benefit if they could sever the link between these political musicians by giving them the tag of prisoners, and the public. But music is the unbreakable shield that can deflect that attempt. With nothing more than their voice, their cherished memories, and often accompanied by makeshift instruments, political prisoners have composed songs that can speak louder than the roar of the oppressor's bullets or cannons.  As I said at the beginning of this article, the human spirit is unbreakable. It has been like that for centuries. Prisoners getting together and developing their own sound and taking the world for a brand new ride—this is the crux of protest music from the world's most isolated places.",2025-08-08T16:38:38Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""zaczz3073"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""bb6757_506ce47f00f643ee8a676c5fec1eb93f~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/i4Zv4QUZcbQ"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""8rysi2926"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""When we ponder what life behind the bars might look or feel like, we more often than not, imagine the echoing silence of a cell, stripped of freedom.

Behind what we perceive, however, this has long been a microcosm of inequities where racism casts an ominous shadow over the creative process and inhibits the well-deserved opportunities for artists of color. If we dig deep to find its roots in the US, what awaits us is a long history of segregation and discrimination. For Black artists, the path to success has been riddled with pitfalls of systemic racism which, unfortunately, still continues to influence their careers, representation, and the very soundscape of music itself. This issue is so deeply embedded in the industry’s structure that it has engulfed everything from production to promotion, distribution, you name it.  Even the legacy of Black artists is no exception. Not only in the US, but also in the British music industry racism is ""serious, upfront and personal"", says the author of a new report about the experiences of black musicians. The Historical Context Such a towering wall of discrimination could not have been manifested within a span of a few decades,  the roots of racial inequality in the music industry trace back to the early 20th century, although the Civil Rights movement was supposed to put an end to this inhumane practice. Black artists in genres such as jazz, blues, and gospel often found themselves struggling for recognition whether through frequent appropriation or underpayment. For example, the great blues singer Ma Rainey, often called the ""Mother of the Blues,"" found herself marginalized despite her foundational role in shaping the genre.  It is unfathomable how mistreated the aspiring and rising artists are if someone like Ma Rainey had to endure this much. Back in the early days of recorded music, major labels were reluctant to sign Black artists. And this led to a practice where Black musicians had no choice but to play for white-owned labels where their music was being capitalized without offering fair compensation.  The ""King of Rock,"" Elvis Presley himself acknowledged in later years how much he drew from Black artists, yet these pioneering Black artists were being overshadowed for decades just because their skin color is darker. Even rock-'n'-roll icons Chuck Berry and Little Richard who were vital to the genre’s creation struggled for recognition during their lifetimes. To clarify, these stories flash out the white-dominated society's view of the Black artists, not white artists'.  Racism in the Modern Music Industry Despite decades of change, racism continues to impact Black artists in many shapes and forms. One significant example would be the problem of gatekeeping, where executives and decision-makers determine which artists get exposure to a bigger audience and which ones don’t. According to a 2018 study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California, Black artists made up only 21% of the top 100 songs of 2018.  Black culture has been undeniably significant in shaping the mainstream music scene, especially when it comes to genres like hip-hop, R&B, and pop. But another study by this initiative also found that across 70 major and independent music companies, just 13.9% of top executives were from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. Furthermore, Black artists often find themselves cooped up in certain genres, impeding their creative freedom and growth. Artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole have spoken out on multiple occasions emphasizing how the industry controls the narrative around their art. On Cultural Appropriation Cultural appropriation refers to the adoption of elements from one culture by members of another culture, often without acknowledgment or respect. In many forms of art, imitation is seen as the highest form of flattery, and rightfully so. It is no different in the field of music. But the ""lack of respect"" is the key point here. The careers of many artists, like Iggy Azalea, who was criticized for appropriating hip hop, expose how Black musical innovations are often capitalized without crediting the original artists. Artists often draw from the greats whom they find inspiring, which is truly a great gesture. However, in many instances, a White artist who has frequently incorporated elements from Black musicians does not face the same criticism as a Black artist would have. Moreover, if we focus on how Black music is marketed and consumed, it becomes obvious that the commercialization of the unique aspects of Black culture brings substantial profits for record labels and companies. But the originators enjoy way less financial or creative benefits than they deserve. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) found that Black artists in the UK earned less per album sale compared to white artists. Apart from album sales, such discrepancies exist on streaming platforms, where Black music is heavily consumed. Black artists continually receive fewer royalties and less financial compensation. Artists Speak Out Nina Simone used her music to protest racism in America with her civil rights anthems “Young, Gifted and Black"". Contemporary artists have shared their experiences with systemic racism and incessantly raised their voices against this. Hip-hop artist Jay-Z has always been vocal about the systemic racism he has faced throughout his career. In his song “The Story of O.J.,” listeners can hear him criticize the way the industry profits off Black musicians while denying their ownership and control over their own music. Duke Ellington said once, 'If jazz means anything, it is freedom of expression.” Creativity and freedom go hand in hand. So, many musicians, like Chance the Rapper, have started avoiding traditional record deals and striving to stay independent. This way they attempt to challenge the industry's archaic practices of exploitation.  Final Words The struggles of Black artists are far from over, but their unweaving courage and passion for what they love continue to shape and influence modern music. It is necessary for the industry, artists, and fans to stand sternly against the blatant display of inequality in the industry, and ensure that every artist is appropriately recognized for their creative endeavor. Equity in the music industry will be established only when all musicians, regardless of race, are given the opportunity to thrive. Until then, the fight will go on, as this fight is as much about culture as it is about justice.",2025-02-14T15:50:18Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""xy7ab402"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""3wyhz400"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""d717d4_04492d002cd6495ba040fba99a2a9186~mv2.jpg""},""width"":2000,""height"":1361}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""9ux2q403"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""6clrw301"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The music industry is celebrated for its creativity and artistry- exactly how it should be.

Every generation has had its own method and approach towards resisting discrimination. In medieval times, honorable men fought against discrimination through word of mouth, spreading messages through local pubs and bars, and creating graffiti on city walls, among other means. In the 1800s and 1900s, most of the movements against crime were made by people in the literature and arts. Poets, artists, and storytellers used to gather influence through their works of art, spreading their message to the general public through literature. In the current generation, the generation of Gen Z, such a message is spread through music, also known as “Protest Music”. They combine the concurrent generational hype genres into a work of deep and meaningful lyricism. Through such lyricism, they spread the message of crime and discrimination, urging the common people to rise to the occasion. As long as human civilisation persists, so will injustice and crime. Every generation  Protest Music In Detail Protest music is not really a genre of music; rather, it can be categorized as a subgenre of all available music. For example, jazz music is generalized through its tune and background music that resembles a mash of blues, ragtime, and Northern European harmony. Hip hop is distinctive due to its strong lyricism and upbeat music. However, protest music doesn’t have a generalized tune or style of lyricism that sets it apart from the rest; rather, protest music can be from any genre, such as jazz, hip-hop, or punk, but it must convey a strong message against the oppressed. Boundless with its creativity and selection of choices among all the genres of music, there truly are no limits.  Some Examples Of Gen Z Protest Music Artists like Wadagliz, Kethan, and Sabi Wu have done terrific work on provoking corrupt corporations and unifying entire countries, races, and liberals to turn up their voices against discrimination. Some of the music these talented artists have composed to rebel against injustice is listed below: Anguka Nayo by Wadagliz Reject lo Bill by Sabi Wu Maandamano by Bien ft. Breeder LW Tumechoka by Kethan Offended 2 by Smallz Lethal ft. Nonini, Issa Sizzo & Willie Oeba Some examples of US-based, appealing to Western culture protest songs are listed below: Alright by Kendrick Lamar FDT by YG & Nipsey Hussie I Can’t Breathe by H.E.R This Is America by Childish Gambino The Bigger Picture by Lil Baby Black Parade by Beyoncé Impact Of Social Media Platforms On Protest Music  During the Medieval era, it took decades to form a movement to raise a voice against discrimination. Messages needed to spread through the wind, to reach enough people and persuade their thoughts and feelings to form a resistance. All while for the messenger and bearer of such messages to remain in cover from the unjust and corrupted powerhouses. So that the safety of both the messengers, the people following the movement, and the people organising the movement can all stay safe under an unjust rule. Things turned better as time went on, and technology prevailed, and telecommunication became a norm for relaying messages. As unbiased newspaper publishers rose to the occasion to cover agendas and incidents that discriminate rights of the common folks. Even then, movements took a significant time to create any impact. Telecommunication was indeed fast and accessible; however, it was still rather slow and steady compared to what we have now, “Social Media”! Through social media, with the help of thousands of viral content creators, preaching any message and reaching over billions of people overnight is no longer impossible. Any message or movement that requires immediate attention faces no obscurity or resistance from any opposing corrupt governing body as it did previously. Social media like Instagram, Facebook, Threads, X, and WhatsApp, all of them are easily accessible, free to use, protect the privacy of the users, and aren’t bound to any governing bodies around the world. Hence, rebellious artists who strive for the betterment of our community are no longer bound to being oppressed when spreading a message. They can whole heartily preach, compose, and elevate protest music while remaining safe themselves and those who follow. Impact Of Protest Music In World Politics And Agendas Protest music has shaped many world agendas into a favorable outcome for the common people. From global warming to protesting against genocide, we shall discuss some of this music in Gen Z that managed to captivate the voices of millions through their art. Movement Against Global Warming As oil-extracting corporations burn through our atmosphere, ozone layer, our ocean, and our icebergs in the Atlantic, protest music has managed to raise a lot of awareness that multiple generations of government events and campaigns failed to do. Such as “4 Degrees” by ANOHNI, a song that psychologically challenges its listeners to contemplate and confront how the global climate is being affected through them, and how it might affect in return to their future generations.  And, “Kyoto Now” by Bad Religion, another protest song that blends punk and metal music to demand action from the US on global climate treaties. Movement Against Racism Racism has been a long-standing problem across the USA and several parts of the world alike. No matter how much it is addressed, the problem still remains to be solved. Hence, even in Gen Z, there are several protest songs against racism  For example, “Alright” by Kendrick Lamar. A lively and hopeful rallying battle cry of a song that brings emphasis like never before on the “Black Lives Matter” movement. And, “I Can’t Breathe” by H.E.R., composed after the murder of George Floyd , is a piece of artistic expression that cries out how justice has become more of a fight rather than a right in this unjust world. Movement Against The Genocide In Palestine  What Israel is doing in Palestine is horrifying, and no matter how you sugarcoat it, it is nothing less than a genocide. A mirror image or worse of what the Nazis did against the jews. Even though the world leaders are sitting ducks in their warm coats and cozy chairs, turning a blind eye, brave, rebellious artists do not. “Hind’s Hall” by Macklemore is a composition that honors the six-year-old Hind Rajab killed in Gaza during the genocide. The artist lashes out at the discriminatory and backward favoritism of media narratives to cover up such an inhumanitarian act, saying, “You can ban TikTok, take us out of the algorithm / But it’s too late, we’ve seen the truth, we bear witness”. Another such composition is “Gaza Is Calling” by Mustafa The Poet. Even though futile, this song still pleads for the world and its leaders to open their eyes and witness the horror for what it is. To put an end to this genocide, as no human deserves such treatment. Final Words We have extensively discussed what Protest Music is and its contribution to our generation in 2025. From fighting against discrimination to bringing words to the doors of world leaders, our brave artists can do it all. However, they won’t be able to do it alone for long; they will need your support, the assistance of the common people. Social media algorithms have been known to deflect controversial issues to avoid them; however, if we all take initiative and challenge the algorithm, maybe we too are doing our part in these protests, despite not being a music composer.",2025-07-04T15:58:13Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""VIDEO"",""id"":""i1i8u1490"",""nodes"":[],""videoData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""video"":{""src"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/NLK2njJzsCA""}}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""3ot3o1380"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""As long as human civilisation persists, so will injustice and crime.

It’s the reality that many of us might never find ourselves in. How I wish I could have said that for every living person.  In today’s modern world, we should supposedly be able to dream nearly anything and make it happen. In some corners of the world, however, making music is deemed as dangerous as speaking out against the established government. Where others casually play instruments on a street corner or post a rap track on YouTube without giving a second thought, musicians in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, and Afghanistan risk arrest, exile, or worse — simply for being heard in some instances. Music becoming entangled in political and religious red tape is not unprecedented, especially in societies where tradition and power go hand in hand. And yet in these societies, time after time, musicians have raised their voices in their own way and against all odds continued writing, singing, and recording. This article explores countries where authoritarian, often theocratic, regimes are hell-bent on suppressing music and subduing musicians, and how those musicians are relentlessly  resisting such oppressive constraints on the freedom of expression. Culture Becomes a Cage Art stirs emotion, and independent art is hard to regulate or manipulate. Thus, the reach and influence of art is threatening for any authoritarian and conservative society that treats culture as something that must be controlled, not cultivated. Music spreads ideas; ideas that are not approved, are nothing short of a ticking time bomb for regimes that rely on manipulation, silence and submission. In many such countries, anything from singing about personal freedom to using “Western instruments” can be cause for punishment. Governments monitor lyrics, close down venues and deny permissions. It’s not unusual for an entire genre to be labeled immoral or anti-national. Apart from politics, in highly religious or patriarchal systems, women face even greater barriers. In places like Afghanistan or Iran, a woman singing in public — or even on a private recording — can trigger outrage. Not because of what she says, but simply because she dares to be heard. Iran: Where Rock and Rap Go Underground Music in Iran is not banned per say, but it’s carefully regulated, like songs need government approval. Also, female vocalists are not allowed to perform solo for mixed audiences. Many artists are forced to record in makeshift home studios, perform in basements, and release tracks online. Then there’s “Confess,” an Iranian heavy metal band who have faced charges in Iran for their anti-religious and anti-government music. They were arrested and charged with blasphemy, and potentially could have faced execution for their allegedly satanic and anti-Islamic music. Now they live in Norway, and their music is still a bold critique of authoritarianism. As for hip-hop, rapper Salome MC should be mentioned. She is known as Iran's first female rapper and recognized as one of the best non-English-speaking hip-hop artists by MTV.  She started in Tehran but now lives in exile in Japan. Her lyrics, delivered in Persian, deal with everything from gender inequality to war trauma. Saudi Arabia: Beats Behind Closed Doors Saudi Arabia, a country with old and rich traditions and culture, made headlines in 2016 for loosening some of its cultural laws under Vision 2030. The aim of this vision is to diversify the economy, reduce dependence on oil, and create a more vibrant, modern society. Under this vision, concerts are now allowed, and cinemas have reopened. But freedom of expression might still be out of reach. The Nascent music scene in this country is starting to flourish. A few years ago, however, artists had to push invisible boundaries quietly. Many groups use hip-hop to express the frustrations of Saudi youth. Their lyrics touch on unemployment, inequality, and the tug of war between tradition and modernity. But they rarely speak openly. In Saudi society, where social reputation can be as dangerous as the law, underground artists constantly balance creativity with caution. But now there might be a chance to bring in change in the music scene of Saudi Arabia. Myanmar: Music in a Time of Crisis A myriad of styles of music and musical instruments can be found in Burmese culture. Yet, at the same time, Myanmar is considered one of the least free countries in the world in terms of censorship, which results from policies to control and regulate information, especially regarding religious, ethnic, political, and moral grounds. Following Myanmar's military coup in 2021, Burmese culture has seen a rise in protest songs. They worked as weapons of resistance. Street chants, acoustic performances, and fiery rock tracks filled the air at rallies. The punk band, Rebel Riot, was formed in 2007 after the onset of the Saffron Revolution. Their mix of punk rock and Buddhist themes grabbed the attention of the audience as well as the authorities. Videos of their protest performances went viral, despite efforts by the junta to erase such content. Others weren’t so lucky. Reggae artist and activist Saw Phoe Kwar was arrested after releasing music critiquing the military. His imprisonment was a message to others: speak out, and you’ll pay for it. Unsurprisingly, musicians keep recording — often anonymously. The only way to release tracks was by utilizing online platforms. It’s risky, but for many, silence feels worse. Afghanistan: A Country Without a Song Few places show the impact of musical repression as starkly as Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Since retaking control in 2021, the Taliban have outlawed music. Radio stations had to replace music broadcasts with religious, patriotic, and jihadist content. Music schools have shut down, and instruments are burned. Musicians flee, hide, or go underground; otherwise, they would be killed. The shocking story of Fawad Andarabi, a folk singer killed by the Taliban, is well known. He wasn’t an activist; he merely sang about his homeland, love, and beauty. However, even that was too much. Institutions like the Afghan National Institute of Music offered hope, especially to young girls. Its all-female Zohra Orchestra, named after the music goddess in Persian writings,  was a global symbol of progress. Now in exile, since the 2021 seizure of Kabul by the Taliban.. Still, Afghan musicians are quietly writing songs, singing, or recording. Escaping the watchful eyes of the Taliban, they are keeping the music alive. On Final Note: Music as Mirror, Music as Weapon Music is a form of self-expression. But in these societies, it becomes something much more. Although we have highlighted societies that are considered conservative so far, the seemingly “non-conservative” societies also harbor some forms of oppression, which might not be easily discernible. Music, or any art form, will still be relevant regardless of the societal structures. In our modern world, every person, every ethnicity, or every community faces challenges every day. Against these challenges, Music has been the universal voice for humans. For women, it’s a challenge to overcome gender norms. For youth, it’s a rejection of societal norms. For anyone, wants to be heard and understood, music is a stand against fear. In any country and society, the underground voices remind us of the necessity of music and how it still matters. When the world is increasingly divided in the name of ideology, religion, and repression, these hidden but unyielding voices are what it truly means to be free.",2025-06-13T15:58:08Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""VIDEO"",""id"":""2hph9738"",""nodes"":[],""videoData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""video"":{""src"":{""id"":""video/ef9da7_decfa841c4c7491c865a2b586fb8afb8/1080p/mp4/file.mp4""},""duration"":70.122},""thumbnail"":{""src"":{""id"":""media/ef9da7_decfa841c4c7491c865a2b586fb8afb8f000.jpg""},""width"":1920,""height"":1080},""title"":""Underground Voices – Inspirational Video.mp4""}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""CENTER""}},""style"":{},""id"":""4bwtq582"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""“Where music is the war-drum of freedom, every note is a rebellion.”"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700},{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}},{""type"":""FONT_SIZE"",""fontSizeData"":{""unit"":""PX"",""value"":20}},{""type"":""ITALIC"",""italicData"":true}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""v3045430"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""2oa5j431"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The preceding pseudo-poetic remark holds the truth for millions of people around the globe.

She is known as one of the most influential African artists with the epithet Africa's premier diva. Throughout her career, Kidjo has displayed her fiery artistry and unwavering commitment to social justice. On one hand, Angélique Kidjo is the African artist with the most Grammy Awards and on the other hand, she is an advocate for women in Africa, working with UNICEF. She has been a magnanimous presence on the international stage for decades. With her powerful voice, she has been preaching the African heritage and misfortune of African women. Angélique Kidjo was born on July 14, 1960, in Ouidah, Benin into a culturally rich family. With her mother, a choreographer and performer, and her father, an amateur musician, she grew up in an artistic environment. From her childhood, she had a spark for music and her family nurtured that spark by providing her appropriate surroundings. Her inauguration to the stage took place at a young age. She performed with her mother's troupe and this exposure sharpened her skill and incited a passion for stage. Her style of music is rooted in her familiarity with a variety of musical genres, including traditional Beninese music, Afrobeat, jazz, and funk.     Following the political unrest in Benin, Kidjo had to leave her homeland and move to Paris. This was the biggest turning point of her life, moving to Paris paved the way for her to become the leading cultural and humanitarian figure of her time. In Paris, she became resolute in pursuing music, despite her initial plan to become a human rights lawyer, and attended CIM, a reputed jazz school. During her studies at CIM, she was able to immerse herself in the pool of diverse and multifarious ideas and stimulants. Anything that she came across, she absorbed it into her own worldview and grew as a human. Kidjo had multiple day jobs as she had to pay for her tuition. This allowed her to experience the bared-down form of life, society, and culture by herself. While living in Benin, Kidjo had already been playing in a band and touring all over West Africa. Her music was featured in the national radio of Benin. After moving to Paris with her stern resolve, she carried on her singing and making music. She started as a backup singer for local bands while working on day jobs. In 1985, she became the leading singer of a popular Euro-African jazz/rock band Pili Pili. With this band, she started her experimentation with Jazz and funk music. Kidjo had always been in touch with her African roots, and that was evident in her style of music as well. She incorporated Afrobeat with jazz and funk. The music soon brought her fame in Paris and she began to rise as one of the most popular live performers. . Kidjo has collaborated with many young artists and worked on projects that showcase the relevance of African tradition in the modern music scene. Her music encourages the younger generation to embrace their roots and explore the ever-expanding artistic horizon. For her 2014 album ""Eve,""  she earned a  Grammy award which was a tribute to the women of Africa. Kidjo is a powerful voice for African women and girls. Through her music, she has always lent her solidarity and compassion to women around the globe. She used her platform to address issues such as poverty, education, and gender equality. She has been working with UNICEF since 2002 as a Goodwill Ambassador. Under UNICEF, she has participated in various initiatives and worked incessantly to improve the quality of life of children and women in Africa. Her music and activism both served as a means for raising social and cultural awareness. One of her major concerns was the lack of education among African girls. She knew very well that her dream of empowering women could not be realized without resolving this issue. Keeping that in mind, she founded the Batonga Foundation in 2006 with the sole purpose of educating African women. The core objective of the Batonga Foundation is to provide support for the most overlooked girls in West Africa and empower them to become the symbol of change and prosperity in their communities and their own lives. This foundation worked relentlessly to provide scholarships, create educational institutes, and promote awareness in communities regarding the importance of girls' education. With Batonga Foundation and UNICEF, she dedicated herself to the pursuit of removing barriers for women so that they can gain equal privilege and opportunity in the community. Our society has been riddled with issues and setbacks for the past century. A sustainable environment is one of those and Kidjo has been a prominent advocate of ensuring a sustainable environment. By making this planet a haven for everyone, it might be possible to break the cycle of endless suffering that humanity has been enduring. Angélique Kidjo is much more than a musician, she is much more than a humanitarian activist. With the history and heritage of centuries old African culture and people, she has reflected in every aspect of her own life. By embracing who she is and where she belongs, she was able to leave a profound impact on the African community. Beyond her achievements and commitment to social justice, she was an African and wore her identity with pride.",2024-09-20T16:00:13Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Angélique Kidjo is a prominent African figure whose presence extends from the TV screen as a singer or an actress to among the masses as an activist.

From ancient times, through medieval minstrels, to modern streets, performers, buskers have given the sidewalks a new purpose. Today, artists often do get to launch their careers and even ascend to global recognition, however, there is also another side to this practice that often raises the eyebrows of society as well. In this article, we are going to explore  the inspiring journeys of musicians who were able to reach the upper echelon of the music industry with the historical context of the seemingly ostentatious practice of performing on the streets, how these performers face challenges to “make it big” or to “make a living.” The History of Busking The word “busker” most likely comes from the mid-17th-century French word “busquer.” The word is obsolete in modern French, but it meant “to seek”. The French word is said to have been taken from the Italian word “buscare “or the Spanish word “buscar.” The original meaning might have been used in a maritime context, meaning ”to cruise about”. The performer's drive for both entertainment and livelihood embodies the sentiment of “seeking.” Historically, buskers have been integral to urban culture. In the 20th century, big cities like London and New York became the mecca for street performance. The earliest known examples of busking or street performance date back to ancient Rome, where performances akin to busking were staples during religious and agricultural festivals. A popular form at the time was “flyting”, a precursor to modern rap battles and poetic exchange of insults, taunts, and accusations, often in verse form, that was a common practice in the 15th and 16th centuries in Scotland.    Then came the fall of Rome. In the centuries that followed, free expression among the common people was heavily restricted. The only performers allowed were those within royal courts, such as jesters, who provided amusement only for the wealthy and influential group of nobles. Artistic expression outside these sanctioned roles was largely forbidden. Entertainment became a privilege of the elite. However, the aristocracy had a soft spot for poetic performers who sang their praises and chronicled their deeds. These flattering tunes often found their way beyond palace walls, trickling into public spaces. Vanity, it seems, has a way of loosening restrictions As these performances became embedded in city life, they often unfolded at busy Roman crossroads during public celebrations aimed at the working class. Eventually, these events garnered support from the Roman authorities, who began to support offering free food and thus promoted state propaganda, using the performances as a way to entertain—and distract—the lower classes. Performing in public places for a sum of money from onlookers or customers in every major culture in the world is not uncommon by any stretch of imagination. For many artists, street performance was a common way of earning money before the rise of recording in the late 19th century, with the experiments of Inventors like Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville and Thomas Edison, with ways to capture and reproduce sound. From Sidewalks to Stardom Here we have a few legendary artists who either began their careers as buskers or did busking at one point in their lives. All of these great artists are prominent in their own respective genres and eras. B.B. King The king of blues, B.B. King, hailed from a little village called Itta Bena, where he was born in a wooden cabin. In his early years, when he wasn’t at church or picking cotton in the fields, he used to set out on foot to busk for some loose change. Rod Stewart  Before becoming a rock icon with over 250 million records, Rod Stewart busked around London with his harmonica as a teenager in the early 1960s. He once busked with folk singer Wizz Jones. They busked at Leicester Square and other parts of London before traveling to Brighton, Paris, and Barcelona. Janis Joplin  During her time at the University of Texas at Austin, Janis Joplin earned her reputation as a free spirit with eccentric habits who would walk around campus barefoot with an autoharp in hand. She was a well-known busker around Austin before deciding to quit college and hitchhike to San Francisco, where she recorded blues standards and struggled with drugs and alcohol. Benjamin Franklin Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States,  is famously known for his contributions to many things, such as science, politics, and writing. Surprisingly, he also had a passion for music and was involved in street performances. David Gilmour David Gilmour with his close friend and future Pink Floyd member, Syd Barrett, while both attended the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology. In 1965, busked around Spain and France with a few of their friends. Tommy Emmanuel Revered as one of the most brilliant acoustic guitarists, Tommy Emmanuel is a guitar virtuoso with unparalleled skills. Way before being famous, Tommy tirelessly spent hours on the streets enthralling audiences with his fiery and unique fingerstyle technique. A Herculean Task Limited Access to Formal Venues Busking is a great way to connect to someone's audience, and many performers walk on this path just because of that. However, many musicians opt for busking due to existing barriers in accessing traditional performance venues.  High costs make it nearly impossible for struggling artists, and busking offers an alternative platform. Economic Necessity and Desire for Independence That brings us to an insurmountable hindrance for many artists, which is a lack of financial stability. For many, busking is a means of financial survival. Others view busking as a way to maintain artistic independence, free from the constraints of commercial contracts and industry expectations. Artists like Gabriel Mayers, who started playing in the subways of New York City, chose street performance over conventional employment while pursuing their passion for music. And he did that to preserve his independence. Social Stigma and Safety Risks Edward McMichael was a celebrated street musician known as Seattle's ""Tuba Man"", who busked outside the city's various sports and performing arts venues. In 2008, he was killed by attackers who were attempting to rob him. As we already know, Benjamin Franklin was a street performer. He composed songs, poetry, and prose with themes revolving around current events. But he was made aware of the fact that it was not worth the stigmas that some people attach to it. Dissuaded, Franklin left busking, and this experience helped to form his beliefs in free speech, which he wrote about in his journal. Epilogue There is something irresistibly unique and authentic about playing music in public spaces, which is exactly what makes it appealing and exciting for performers as well as audiences. The spontaneity and unfiltered feedback from the listeners contribute to a performance that is raw and real. As buskers, musicians are required to be resilient, creative, and genuine in their art. Despite facing economic challenges, social stigma, and limited access to formal venues, there are always musicians performing on the streets as a stepping stone to mainstream success.  Busking is a vital part of the contemporary music scene.  In an era where digital media dominates, it would not have been surprising if it was disregarded at one point or another over numerous decades. But the very nature of street performance continues to captivate passersby and serves as a reminder of music's communal roots.",2025-05-23T16:49:16Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""0f8b5852"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_9dbc216ec064457992f2d8776a0b0477~mv2.jpg""},""width"":910,""height"":608},""altText"":""From Street Corners to Streaming Charts: The Buskers Who Made It""}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""cwe0h855"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""JUSTIFY""}},""style"":{},""id"":""40lzd719"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""For a very long time, “Busking” has been serving as a platform for artists to connect with audiences more instantly.

Szpilman grew up with music which led him to become one of the most prominent pianists and composers of his time. His journey, however, was altered by the unprecedented events of World War II, where he had to face unimaginable adversity as a Jewish musician. His haunting yet inspiring experiences in occupied Poland during World War II were documented in his memoir, ""The Pianist,"" which was later adapted into an acclaimed film by Roman Polanski. Here, we are going to look into Szpilman's early life, his struggle during WWII, his post-war contributions to music, and all in all, the rise and the legacy of his extraordinary artists. To understand Władysław Szpilman and his legacy, we need to start at the very beginning, i.e. his early years. He was born on 5 December 1911 in Sosnowiec, Poland. Being born into a musical family, undoubtedly shaped his future in music. His parents provided an environment rich in musical influence. As a result of this early exposure to music led him to pursue formal education in the field. Following this auspicious beginning in his childhood, Szpilman began his study of the piano at the Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw, Poland. There he studied piano with two of the pupils of one of the greatest classical composers pianist Franz Liszt, Aleksander Michałowski, and Józef Śmidowicz. Their training ingrained in him a profound understanding of classical repertoire. Amidst all this classical training, Szpilman was developing a love for contemporary music, particularly jazz. This explains his famous pop compositions and soundtracks. In 1931, having received a scholarship to attend the prestigious Academy of Arts in Berlin, Germany.  where he studied piano under  Artur Schnabl and the art of composing Franz Schreker. Berlin was the place where he flourished as a pianist and composer. Here he wrote his first compositions, especially suites for piano and symphonies. Szpilman was having a good life. His perseverance was being rewarded and dreams were coming true one by one. He started performing for audiences in 1933 upon returning to Warsaw. By the 1930s, Szpilman had already proven himself as one of Poland’s leading pianists and composers. By virtue of his versatility, he could move seamlessly between classical concerts and popular music. His efforts were truly bearing fruits. In this period of life, he started performing on stage as well as touring with acclaimed musicians such as violinist Roman Totenberg, Ida Haendel, Henryk Szeryng, and U.S. violinist, Bronislav Gimpel. In 1935, he joined Polish Radio as a pianist and his work on Polish Radio aided popularization of jazz and contemporary classical music in Poland. He has already established himself as one of the greats in Poland. Szpilman's promising career was about to be interrupted by the Nazi occupation of Poland following the outbreak of World War II. On the fateful day, 23 September 1939, Polskie Radio was bombed, moments after broadcasting a Chopin recital for the last time played by Szpilman.  As a Jewish musician, Szpilman and his family faced immediate danger. In 1940, Jewish families were forced into the largest Nazi ghetto, the Warsaw Ghetto. He and his family were also imprisoned as their house was already located in this area. Despite the gradual worsening of this dreadful situation, Szpilman continued to play the piano in the ghetto's cafés, since it was his only way of providing for his family. On second thought, these gigs might also have been the only source of solace for him as well amidst the horror. As if this much wasn't enough, he had to witness the deportation of his family to an extermination camp in 1942. This was the last time he saw his family as none of them survived the war. Szpilman stayed back and participated in the Jewish resistance uprising by smuggling weapons. In the following year, the ghetto was dissolved, he was practically on his own, thus began his solitary struggle for survival. With the help of his friends and fellow musicians, he managed to meet both ends. But, during the final months of the war, Szpilman found refuge in a deserted building, endured extreme hunger, and cold, and lived in a constant fear of discovery. In a twist of fate, Szpilman was discovered in a dilapidated building in Warsaw. He was discovered by Wilm Hosenfeld, a German officer who, upon learning of Szpilman's identity as a pianist, took him to a piano in the next room. With the looming danger over him, Szpilman played for the German officer and won him over. Impressed with his playing, Hosenfeld displayed his humanity amidst the barbaric aggression providing Szpilman with food and supplies on several occasions until the Germans retreated. Eventually, the war ended in 1945, and Szpilman survived. He overcame each and every ordeal thrown at him and returned to Polish Radio, resuming his career where he had left it. It is said that his first post-war performance was the very same Chopin piece, Nocturne in C-sharp Minor, that had been interrupted by the German invasion in 1939. This was a symbolic act of resilience. In the following years, Szpilman took the position of director in the Popular Music Department at Polish Radio and performed in Poland, as well as throughout Europe, Asia, and America. He went on to compose several symphonic works and about 500 other compositions that are still remembered today. Szpilman's extraordinary life story and musical contributions were largely recognized posthumously. His memoir Śmierć Miasta” (Death of a City) was reissued in 1998 under the title “The Pianist"", which recounted his harrowing experiences during the war.  The memoir gained international fame, especially after it was adapted into the 2002 film. Władysław Szpilman’s indomitable spirit and his contributions to music, particularly in Poland, are profound. His story continues to inspire us, reminding us to provide consolation and hope even in the darkest times. He survived the Nazi occupation, the Warsaw ghetto, and the Holocaust. His legacy lives on through his music and his life.

The Thar’s sandy beige dunes and extreme conditions deceptively hide the vibrancy of its inhabitants. These inhabitants have found a way of life that can flourish only in the Great Indian Desert—a region of rolling sand hills.  Among the inhabitants, we can find those who are known as Manganiar, a community with a cultural heritage and musical traditions that have sustained them for centuries. One of the most captivating musical traditions in the world is their blend of folk, classical, devotional, and Sufi music – a dynamic, evocative form of storytelling passed down through generations. The Manganiars is a community of Muslim musicians predominantly found in Rajasthan, one of the Indian states, where many areas are underdeveloped and lack the touch of modern sensibility. Moreover, the manganiars continue to uphold and take pride in ancient traditions passed down through generations. In this article, we will delve into the history, significance, and unique characteristics of Manganiar music and their ""melody of the Thar"" to explore its enduring legacy and its role in the rich cultural tapestry of India.   (This article is exclusively on the Manganiar community and their music, however, there is another muslim community, The Langha, in Rajasthan. Both sing in the same dialect, but their style and repertoires differ, shaped by the tastes of their patrons.)  The Origins of the Manganiar Community The Manganiars are believed to have descended from a combination of native Rajputs and Muslim artisans who arrived in Rajasthan from Central Asia during the Mughal period. The Manganiar has always been associated with music, and its members often performed for various Rajput kings and wealthy patrons, traditionally known as  ‘Jajman,’ across Rajasthan. Their patronage allowed Manganiar musicians to sharpen and hone their craft, elevating the cultural diversity of Rajasthan. In Rajasthan, where life is both physically and spiritually demanding, music is bound to become a means of emotional, spiritual, and cultural expression. Unsurprisingly, the roots of Manganiar traditions can be traced to the Sufi mysticism, with influences from Persian and Afghan musical practices brought by the Mughal Empire. The cultural exchange between the indigenous Rajput music and these new influences gave rise to such a unique fusion of musical styles, which is now the bedrock of Manganiar music. The term “Manganiar” carries the meaning of a beggar adorned with a garland. The word mangan  means ""to beg"", and haar means ""a garland of flowers."" As the legend says, “The daughter of prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Bibi Fatema, offered a necklace (haar) to a Mirasi named Mangan. From this time onwards, they were called the 'Manganhar and the community is now known as Manganiyar.” Music in Manganiar Society  Music is central to the lives of the Manganiar community. Music is passed on from generation to generation orally and aurally. It is a hereditary aspect of not only their culture but also their identity. From birth to death, the major events of their lives must involve music, which adds an emotional layer to the proceedings. Traditionally, the Manganiars, while performing at celebrations such as weddings and religious events, utilize their songs as vehicles for storytelling. The Manganiar children have an inherent sense of melodies and beats regardless of their ages, which are further developed through informal training by their families predominantly. Every Manganiar learns from their parents or grandparents, and every household is a gymnasium for musical training. A child does train under a Guru to become a professional musician, but their first introduction to music starts through their mother's lullaby.  Traditionally, women are not allowed to perform in front of anyone who is not her family. So, the men are the performers in their community. But, when it comes to the expertise and proficiency, the women have in their musical heritage is undoubtedly on par with the men. And this is evident from the testimonies of famous Manganiar musicians who accredited their mother for their training and inspiration in their early years. The Structure and Themes  Mangainars pass on their songs and singing to their sons, brothers, and nephews by inheritance in their own community.  However, they themselves do not even know when the new generation will absorb all the elements of singing without actively immersing themselves in the process of learning. Thus, the Manganiar community seems to be less dependent on the social structure and more contributing to it.  The musicians also play the role of traditional genealogists for their jajmans. This record-keeping through songs is entirely an oral tradition. The “Shubhraj,” which is a song that keeps the genealogical record, sung by the Manganiar, makes references to the whole of the patrons’ lineage and praises their glorious past and ends with prayers for their well-being in the future. Along with the Subhraj, they also sing the Bakhaan, which is essentially in praise of the jajman and his family.  These musician communities have a huge repertoire of songs on lifecycle, seasons, daily living, epics, ballads, folklores, gods and goddesses, Pirs and Fakirs, sufiyana kalams, bhajans, and qawwalis. Some of the most important themes are different phases of life such as birth, youth, marriage, etc, which are celebrated by the Jajmans through music of the Manganiar. Also, Monsoons in the desert are always welcomed.  Manganiar people do this through music and romantic songs.  Ragas and Instruments Manganiar songs are mostly based on ragas–melodic frameworks for improvisation in Indian classical music. Specific ragas are associated with different times of the day. Theoretically, songs of a particular raga must begin with a couplet or duha, which in Rajasthani means the introductory part of the song, which is non-metered but based on the same raga as the song. The key instruments played by the Manganiyars are exclusively made by local artists, using materials such as animal skin and bones, different types of wood, and grass. “Kamaicha” is a 17-string bowed instrument made of mango wood. The rounded resonator is covered with goat skin. “Khartaal” is a kind of castanet which is played by hands (Khar) to keep rhythms (taal). Hence the name Khartaal. “Dholak” is a hand drum similar in timbre to a bongo. A dholak may have traditional lacing or turnbuckle tuning. The Manganiar Musical Tradition on the Modern Stage Despite the persistence of their rich musical heritage, the Manganiar community couldn't remain untouched by the forces of modernization. The global media has helped gain the traditional Manganiar performances international attention, especially after the 2000s. Artists from the Manganiar community have collaborated with musicians from around the world. In these collaborations, the fusion of their folk traditions with contemporary music genres like pop, jazz ,and electronic music has brought Manganiar music global recognition. Being recognized is not an issue by itself, if this centuries old tradition does not lose its authenticity in the pursuit of materialistic achievements by the younger generations. In the past few decades, it has been proved that Manganiar music can hold its candle on the global stage as effortlessly as it does on its home turf (For proof, take a look at 'Manganiyar Seduction' at the 2011 Melbourne Festival). All we need is dedicated and devoted generations who are comfortable and proud of who they are and where they come from and are willing to move forward with the burden of an ancient tradition on their shoulders. Epilogue The music of the Manganiar community is the pulse of the Thar Desert itself. Their cultural landscape and its rich and complex art forms bridge the historical, religious, and artistic traditions of what used to be, what is, and what will be. Through their songs, the Manganiars offer a peek into the soul of Rajasthan and retell the chronicles of life in the desert. Their music is a timeless melody reverberating the Great Indian Desert Thar.",2025-05-09T15:59:03Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""e6nwr462"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_0199d226aaa542a09e668f37dad178ec~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1043,""height"":695},""altText"":""Melody of the Thar: Into Manganiar Musical Traditions""}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""3ktvi467"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The Thar Desert, one of the largest arid regions in the world, extends its barren beauty across the Indian subcontinent, which stretches from the northwestern regions of India into Pakistan.

He is not a mere singer; but a storyteller, poet, singer of praise, entertainer, and verbal historian. His golden tenor voice reverberates the hearts of millions of audiences with mighty power and immovable conviction. He devoted his life to representing the rich and vibrant culture and heritage of Senegal in a new light and conveying his political and social messages across Africa to the wider world. Rolling Stone magazine aptly declared him ""perhaps the most famous singer alive"" in Senegal and the African continent. Born in 1959, N’Dour was raised in a household where his parents were devout Sufi Muslims. His father was a Serer father and his mother was of Toucouleur descent, a carrier of the bardic griot tradition. Culturally and linguistically he grew up basking in the traditions of Wolof which was common for people of Dakar since the mid-20th century. Both Seher and Toucouleur people are mostly Muslims, the latter being among the first Muslims in the area that became Senegal. With the influences from the aforementioned cultures and additionally being a Muslim of the Mouride brotherhood— a taalibé in Wolof— Sufism had a profound influence on N'Dour. His music often drew from the aspects of Islamic music and chants. The culmination of inspirations from these cultures and N'Dour's adherence to them shaped his lifestyle and musicality. Inclination to the Modern worldview of his parents, he internalized the dynamics of modern urban life. He is considered a modern griot. A griot is an African tribal storyteller and musician who plays the role of preserving the genealogies and oral traditions of a tribe. N’Dour has always maintained the griot tradition and has showcased how it can build a narrative about our technology-driven world. You N’Dour is maintaining the griot tradition and has shown that it can also be changed into a narrative about the entire world. that it can also be changed into a narrative about the entire world. At N'Dour's neighborhood in religious festivals, he started singing at the age of 12. His rise to stardom in Senegal occurred after joining Étoile de Dakar. This group incorporated the Senegalese tama, talking drum, and Wolof songs into a modern music repertoire. This became a pioneer of a new genre of music known as Mbalax, an urban dance music style rooted in the indigenous instrumental and vocal styles with polyrhythmic drumming of the Wolof. This style upheld the social identity of the original Wolof people of the Greater Senegambia region which arose during colonialism. After this influential group disbanded, N'Dour, with guitarist Jimi Mbaye, bassist Habib Faye, and tama player Assane Thiam, formed Super Étoile de Dakar and produced four albums. In 1984, He had a breakthrough with the release of  ""Immigres,"" which addressed the struggles of African migrants. The themes of displacement and identity resonated with the masses and N'Dour garnered critical acclaim and devoted followers. Super Étoile de Dakar performed for the first time in Europe in 1984, for an African cultural festival in Paris called the Africa Fête. After such a triumphant show he continued touring in other European countries. In France, he even made contact with the Celluloïd label, and this label released Youssou N'Dour's records worldwide. In the hands of a visionary like N’Dour l, Mbalax was being further Africanized and updated. The sound of mbalax became expansive and more appealing with the addition of Senegalese sabar drums, keyboards, and electric guitars in the ensemble. Parallel to the new style of instrumentation, his lyrics began to address the pressing political and social issues such as apartheid. In his songs, N'Dour underscored the importance of revitalizing the African cultural identity in a world that promotes and propagates cultural homogenization.  In the mid-80s, N’Dour toured extensively in Europe and North America. His concerts were huge hits. His magnificent stage presence and impressive vocal range propelled his popularity among global audiences. His singing on Peter Gabriel’s international hit “In Your Eyes,” and the exposure through the Human Rights Now! concert with Gabriel and Bruce Springsteen, among other rock artists, he had earned international recognition.  The first release ""Eyes Open"", produced by N'Dour in his studio Xippi Studio in Dakar, got a Grammy Nomination. However, the release of his solo album ""The Guide,"" made him a true global star. The track ""7 Seconds,"" with Swedish singer-songwriter Neneh Cherry, became a worldwide hit. Sung in three languages, this song features Cherry's sweet and charming voice in contrast to N'Dour's gritty vocal.  In the spirit of the griot’s heritage as a storyteller, the songs never shied away from offering a voice for political and social commentary on religion and current events. Apart from Human Rights Now! Tour, he organized a concert for the release of Nelson Mandela. He was becoming a cultural icon not only in Senegal but also in Africa and beyond. In 2003, N'Dour canceled his American tour as he publicly criticized and stood against the upcoming American invasion of Iraq. N'Dour had earned numerous accolades and held reputable positions in various organizations and institutions. He was nominated as Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN and worked with the United Nations and UNICEF to be the bridge among Senegalese communities around the world. The Japan Art Association awarded N’Dour the Praemium Imperiale for music. This prestigious prize recognizes lifetime achievements in various fields which are usually not covered by the Nobel Prize. Youssou N'Dour is a rare breed of musician whose music and activism are inseparable from who he is as a proud Senegalese. Quantifying his legacy is in no way sufficient, if not outright blasphemous, to measure up his remarkable contributions to music and his unwavering dedication to improving the lives of his people. N’Dour has worked to reduce animosities between his own religion, Islam, and other religions.

Whether someone is a seasoned music lover or a new listener, Dhafer can talk and connect with the listener invitingly. So welcoming yet his music has so many layers the more mindfully you listen to his music the more beauty it reveals.  Dhafer's music speaks directly to the heart without the need to understand the lyrics of the songs even though the Arabic lyrics he uses are art itself. In this article, we will delve into the mystic world of Dhafer Youssef and how his rich cultural heritage and spirituality have shaped his music and view on life. Dhafer Youssef was born in Teboulba, a small village on the coast of Tunisia. Born into a modest family with eight children, Dhafer comes from a long line of muazzins(the muezzin is the person who calls the crowd to the daily prayer Muslims call Azan). Born during the repressive reign of the dictator Ben Ali, Dhafer’s exposure to music comes from different sources. His musical training began when he was three. His grandfather took him to the Qur'anic school where he discovered his vocal potential. But his main tutor was his mom’s radio. In an interview, he said, “Actually I come from the Qur'anic school. My grandfather was a muezzin, so religious music is part of my life. That’s really my background. But I have to say that the radio was the most important school for me. That was my window into the world. I was listening to the radio in my mother’s kitchen, and I have to tell you, I was listening to everything without making any judgment: rock, classical, Indian, Brazilian, African, everything.” At the age of six, he discovered the resonance of his voice by singing in the local Hammam. But it was the sound of the oud, the North African lute, that excited him. ""It felt like the sound of home,"" he recalls. ""I’d hear music on the radio without knowing what it was, but the moment I heard the oud, it struck a deep chord within me."" The connection ran so deep that he tried to craft his own instrument using tin cans and bits of string. ""It was a hopeless attempt,"" he admitted. His father was not poor but with eight children in the house, they hardly could bear the luxury of buying an oud or music lessons. Picking up melodies by ear and experimenting with his voice Dhafer started to get hired to sing at weddings at an early age. Saving up his earnings he at last bought a real oud. He learned oud and electric bass and discovered “groove” at the youth center in Teboulba. He relocated to Tunisia to attend the Nahj Zarkoun Conservatory in search of broader opportunities but becoming dissatisfied with the traditional teaching, he left for Vienna, Austria. He recalls. “Everyone at home said, no, you’re crazy. You have a voice, you should stay here and sing. But I wasn’t listening.” Dhafer Youssef's life underwent a significant change when he moved to Vienna to pursue his passion. He took on any job he could find to fund his life in Vienna, from washing dishes and windows to working as an Italian waiter despite not being Italian. He went through an ocean filled with diversity that changed the course of his artistic journey as he became fully immersed in the city's multiculturalism. Dhafer first enrolled in musicology, but quickly concluded that academic training wasn't for him. All of the struggles he chose to face paid off. During his stay, he discovered jazz and was introduced to Indian music through his jamming sessions in bars and clubs. In 1996 working with Anton Burger, Achim Tang, Jatinder Thakur, and Otto Leichner led to the creation of the album Musafir. The Porgy and Bess jazz club in Vienna offered him to arrange a series of monthly performances, practicing whatever he liked with whoever he wanted. However, he was playing with a tabla player every day and had already partnered with a violist. He had a cultural awakening. During this time, he formed his first band, Zeryab, with Austrian percussionist Gerhard Reiter. In nine months, he gained experience equivalent to ten years working with the French virtuoso. In 1999 he debuted his first solo album, Malak. The album introduced the world to Dhafer’s fusion of jazz and traditional Arabic music. In 2001 working with Wolfgang Muthspiel (Guitar), Markus Stockhausen (Trumpet), Deepak Ram (Bansuri), Dieter Ilg (Bass), Mino Cinelu (Percussions), Rodericke Packe (Electronics), Will Calhoun (Drums) and Doug Wimbish (Bass), Dhafer created the album Electric Sufi. This experiment enabled him to use his voice as a separate instrument. In 2003 working with Electro-Jazz Scandinavian musicians he released Digital Prophecy. He was nominated two times for the BBC Awards for World Music 2003. 2006’s Shadow Devine was responsible for his 3rd BBC World Music nomination. Working with Tigran Hamasyan, the drummer Mark Giuliana, and the double-bass player Chris Jennings he released his 5th album Abu Nawas Rhapsody. Released in 2013 according to DownBeat Magazine, Birds Requiem is one of the Top 10 Jazz Albums. The release received praise from music critics worldwide. He released three more albums 2016’s Diwan of Beauty and Odd, 2018’s Sounds of Mirrors, featuring Zakir Hussain on tabla and Hüsnü Şenlendirici on clarinet, and 2023’s Street of Minarets, with contributions from jazz legends Herbie Hancock, Marcus Miller, and Dave Holland. Throughout the years Dhafer Youssef has been a part of approximately 10 collaborations, showcasing his commitment to pushing musical boundaries. Dhafer Youssef’s music and philosophy reflect a profound blend of humility, optimism, and spirituality. Deeply influenced by Sufi mysticism, he sees music as a personal form of prayer and a way to connect people beyond religious or cultural boundaries. It is this sincerity, spiritual depth, and unwavering optimism, that makes his music resonate so profoundly with listeners around the world. He explains, “I’m not trying to teach anyone, or tell them what to do, I’m just trying to share with them my story. Because I really feel that I was born a musician. I know that my folks back home still worry about how I’m managing to live and I’d probably tell my own children if they were trying to choose between music and a more secure job, to take the secure job.

But, what if that oracular remark, within a year or two, gets realized and the whole world witnesses the birth and rise of a global superstar of South African music? This is the story of  Brenda Fassie, one of the greatest pop icons of Africa, who emerged from humble beginnings to set out to become one of the most celebrated and controversial figures in South African music. Her life, her career, and her achievements were marked by a remarkable unyielding spirit that resonated deeply with her fans. Born on November 3, 1964, in Langa, Cape Town, South Africa, Brenda was the youngest of 9 siblings. Her mother was a pianist, so it is needless to say that from a very early age, this exposure fostered her passion for singing. By the age of five, she had already started performing with her mother on stage and established her own niche as a vocalist in her town. Tourists were already paying to hear her singing. Moreover, during this Brenda formed her own group called the Tiny Tots, a singing and dancing group that Fassie's mother had founded.  By the age of 16, she was performing in local bands and honing her craft. Her first significant break came when famous producer  Hendrick ""Koloi"" Lebona came from Johannesburg and paid a visit to Brenda. This turned out to be an auspicious beginning of a stellar life and career for her.  Lebona was already aware of her prominence in the local township (which refers to an urban area in Cape Town), as many musicians from Cape Town had praised Brenda’s singing. During his visit, Lenona came to realize that she might be, in his own words, ‘the voice of the future.'  To achieve her dream of becoming a famous, rich and world-renowned singer, she moved to  Soweto, Johannesburg with Lebona in 1981. She was supposed to finish her education before embarking on her journey as a singer. But, soon after she arrived in Soweto, she was recruited in a vocal group Joy, as a substitute for one of its members. Following this came the opportunity to join a township music group called Brenda and the Big Dudes; this time as a lead singer. With this group, she gained recognition for her powerful voice as well as popularity for her uniquely vibrant stage presence.  This group was a backing band for another popular South African duo in its earlier days. Then came young Brenda Fassie and together they released their debut single” Weekend Special” in 1983. The single became the best-selling record of that time–in South Africa with sales of over 200,000 copies. This single brought on international popularity and  Brenda, with her group, went on a tour to the United States, Britain, Europe, Australia and Brazil. Unfortunately, her days with this group were marked. In 1987, they disbanded, and it presented Brenda with a serendipitous opportunity to pave a path for herself as a solo artist.  Throughout the 80s, Brenda was gradually establishing herself as a pop star. In 1987, she released  “Ag Shame Lovey” and her eponymous album “Brenda,” both received positive reviews from music critics and featured a few of her all-time great tracks. This was just the first of the firestorms she was yet to summon. Brenda was also working with producer Sello “Chicco” Twala in the late 1980s. They established a successful endeavor in the South African music industry.  Their album  “Too Late for Mama” achieved platinum status in 1989. Brenda Fassie's impact on South African music and culture is virtually immeasurable.  Her music not only influenced the sound of kwaito ( a South African genre of music) but also paved the way for future generations of artists. It challenged societal norms and gave a voice to the voiceless, particularly in the township communities where she grew up. Her outspoken views and closely knitted friendship with people of poorer townships made her immensely popular. Her songs became anthemic to hope and resilience and symbolized the quest for freedom and equality in post-apartheid South Africa. The song's infectious beat and Brenda's charismatic vocals deeply resonated with listeners. Known for flashy and flamboyant personality and performance, her concerts became legendary. Her music was revered by critics and she was idolized by her fans. However, such immaculate success came with a price. Along with her life as a musician, her personal life and relationships often made headlines.  In 1990, she and her husband, Nhlanhla Mlambo were sued for fraud.  She faced significant struggles with substance abuse as well. Her drug habits jeopardized her music career and she had to be admitted to a drug rehabilitation center.  With the news of her drug and alcohol abuse, her bisexuality also grabbed public attention through frequent coverage of this issue on media platforms. The tumultuous experiences of her life only seemed to amplify her artistry. Her raw, emotional tracks spoke of her battles with love, loss, and identity. She channeled her pain and experiences with utmost honesty into her music. This transparency about her struggles made her a relatable figure. Her relevance and popularity never faded. She went on to win five South African Music Awards for “Best Female Artist” as well as “Best-Selling Release of the Decade”  in 2004, and “Lifetime Achievement Award” in 2005. In 2001, Time magazine solidified her position as a global icon by calling her “The Madonna of the Townships”. Brenda Fassie's journey from the streets of Langa to becoming a cultural icon will serve as an inspiration to many. She will always be the “MaBrrr” to her fans.

Mankind has kept on pursuing a path of fulfillment for eternity. Music has proven, time after time, its deeper and uncanny connection to the eluding realm of spirituality. Every human who ever lived craved a stimulant that would illuminate their inner world. Music has been that stimulant for many centuries and continues to serve till now. To stir up something inside others' inner world requires conquering one's own inner self. Who has achieved triumph over oneself better than musicians?  ""To be a musician, there has to be a fire burning in you,"" explained  Alim Qasimov, one of the major Mugham singers in Azerbaijan. He is described by The New York Times as Qasimov ""one of the greatest singers alive."" This article inquires into this legendary musician's life and work and aims to unveil the inner world of an artist. In a village called Nabur near Baku the capital of Azerbaijan, Alim Qasimov was born in 1957. At that time, the country was a part of the Russian Empire. His parents worked in a Soviet commune and young Qasimov started working there as well, following his parents. Poverty was an inescapable reality for Qasimov. In retrospect, this humble beginning in a rural area turned out to be a blessing for him. He never separated himself from his origin, he embraced it. Qasimov's father, a humble man with a good singing voice, could not think about having a professional career in singing. However, he did not overlook the fire of desire for music in his son's heart. He wanted their son to achieve things that were beyond their imagination. Unable to afford an instrument, Qasimov's father made a makeshift drum for him using goat's stomach lining on a frame. With this little support, Qasimov took his first step towards his spiritual fulfillment. With his parent's boundless support, he started performing at religious events and participated in a local music contest. It did not go well for 14-year-old Qasimov, as the traditional form posed a challenge for him. He had to overcome this hurdle, as he soon realized he had musical talent. For him, it was either singing or nothing. Having been persuaded by his parents, he enrolled in the state music school in Baku at the age of 21 years. It did not take much time before his teachers and peers recognized the impressive aptitude Qasimov had. In this music school, he specialized in vocal techniques, in particular, the repertoire of classical Azerbaijani songs—Mugham. Alim studied at the Asaf Zeynalli Music College and the Azerbaijan University of Arts.  A renowned Mugham singer Aghakhan Abdullayev was his mentor. As Qasimov shares a profound connection with Mugham, before going any further, we need to understand what it is. Mugham has a thousand years of musical tradition and is a highly complex art form which is an intricate interplay of classical poetry and musical improvisation. It is considered to be the classical music of Azerbaijan and a traditional musical form characterized by a high degree of improvisation and incorporation of popular stories and local melodies. As Mugham is a modal system,  specific local modes accompany an orally transmitted collection of melodies and melodic fragments that performers can make use of during improvisation. In 2003, the Mugham of Azerbaijan a ""Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity""  and  Qasimov's touring and promotion of the Mugham played a significant and crucial role in this. Under Soviet rule, practicing and performing Mugham was looked down upon. In such harsh reality, Qasimov began his professional life as a singer. But, he was indomitable. In 1983 he won the national Jabbar Garyaghdioghlu Singing Competition. Qasimov’s distinctive voice, paired with his deep understanding of the nuances of Mugham, allowed him to tap into the ability to connect with his audiences at a deeper level. As his career progressed, he garnered both national and international recognition owing to his performances that often incorporated elements of storytelling and evocative lyrics. This combination resonated with the global audience. These achievements led him to win awards at the UNESCO Symposia on Traditional and Modern Art of Central Asian and Asian Countries. Following Azerbaijan's declaration of independence, the artistic importance of Azeri culture began to be recognized internationally. Qasimov was named the ""People's Artist of Azerbaijan"" in 1993 and earned the highest honor in his field in 1999 when he won the International IMC-UNESCO Music Prize. Qasimov recorded and internationally released his music for the first time, beginning with Classical Mugham, A collaboration with the Mansurov brothers, in 1998 he recorded and internationally released  Art of the Mugham and Legendary Art of Mugham. In 1999, Qasimov with his daughter, Ferghana Qasimova, participated in “The Spirit of the East"" concert. Such active participation in initiatives to preserve and promote traditional music made Qasimov a cultural ambassador for Azerbaijan. The ever-increasing pressure of globalization led to changes in cultural consumption, especially to younger audiences. Qasimov faced a challenge in finding a balance between tradition and modernity. To address this, he took an innovative approach collaborated with artists from various musical backgrounds, and experimented with new forms of expression.  In doing so, he reached a wider audience without compromising the integrity of Mugham. To incite curiosity and passion for Mugham, he teaches at Asaf Zeynally Music School in Baku. The ancient poetic traditions of Azerbaijan are still relevant in the global stage of contemporary music. It is undeniable that Alim Qasimov has played a major role in this with his majestic voice.

The magnificent work in Carnatic music and rediscovery of the mandolin's role within the traditional framework of Indian classical music earned him the moniker the Mozart of classical Indian music. He brought a fluid sound to his instrument that was unexplored by mandolinists working in any genre and became one of the most globally revered South Indian musicians. His extraordinary talent, soulful interpretations, and innovative approach played a key role in elevating stardom on the global stage.     U. Srinivas was born in 1969, in Palakollu, a small town in Andhra Pradesh, India, in a family that was closely tied to the traditional music of South India. His father, U. Satyanarayana, an accomplished musician, ran a light music ‘orchestra’ called Saraswati Music Party that performed in Nellore and Vijayawada. As a kid, Srinivas showed little interest in music whatsoever except for a chance to discover his father who caught him meddling around with the Mandolin at home and realized the talent of his son. He bought Srinivas a new mandolin and started teaching him as his first guru. It happened when Srinivas was five years old, and at that young age began his journey into music. By the time Srinivas turned nine, had already made his debut public Carnatic concert performance in 1978 during a festival called Thyagaraja Aradhana.    The remarkable and rare talent he possessed on such an unusual instrument was instantly recognized. The mandolin had existed in folk traditions within the country for many generations, however, the traditional Carnatic instruments like the veena or violin were common choices. But Srinivas was drawn to the mandolin despite being initially introduced to it as a toy. Srinivas soon demonstrated an extraordinary feat of weaving intricate melodies only through listening. His guru, Rudraraju Subbaraju, did not know how to play the mandolin. So, he would just sing pieces from the Carnatic classical repertoire, and U. Srinivas would play them on the mandolin. Thus, developing an unprecedented style of playing entirely his own and on an instrument that had never been played in the rigorous and difficult Carnatic style before. For this reason, Srinivas is credited for its introduction into the Carnatic tradition.    The raw unrefined emotion in his playing was hard to match and did not take long to captivate both musicians and music enthusiasts. In the early 1980s, Srinivas’s career showed a meteoric rise following his first public concert in Chennai at the Indian Fine Arts Society. Despite playing an unconventional instrument, he won over purists with his sheer brilliance, since you need to hear his interpretations once to realize the emotional depth they have behind the obvious technical virtuosity.    Srinivas started off playing an acoustic mandolin, but it did not allow him to play lengthy, sustained notes and other core elements that defined classical Indian music. So, he switched to the electric mandolin as he felt free to experiment however he wanted. As an added benefit, it became easier to make what he was playing more audible. He was the first musician to use the electric mandolin in Carnatic music.  He even modified the electric Western instrument, using five single strings instead of the traditional four doubled strings to make it more suitable for the Carnatic pitch, raga system, and especially gamaka which is the Indian classical style of embellishment.    The modified version of the mandolin produced a sound that was both sharp yet retained the rich timbre and sounded soulful, perfectly complementing the depth of Carnatic compositions. Srinivas’s performances were noted for their flawless execution, emotional depth, and extraordinary command of rhythm and melody.     Srinivas started performing regularly in the prestigious Madras Music Academy in 1982 where a slot used to be reserved for U. Srinivas every year and it was one of the highest praise an artist could get. International recognition came soon after. In the mid-1980s, Srinivas began touring globally, introducing mandolin and Carnatic music to audiences in Europe, North America, and Australia. At the age of thirteen, he was booked to play a half-hour concert after Miles Davis at the Berlin Jazz Festival. No wonder, Srinivas ended up winning a standing ovation from the audience and had to play for another hour. After recording a fusion album with Michael Brook, Srinivas was asked by John McLaughlin to join “Remember Shakti”, and tour the world with it, along with other Indian musicians Zakir Hussain, Shankar Mahadevan, and V. Selvaganesh. It was the revival of the legendary jazz fusion band Shakti following a twenty-year hiatus.    As a youngster, Srinivas had an amazingly natural touch and sensibility which stayed with him till his last performance, the Midas touch. Mandolin Ecstasy, one of the earliest LPs by Srinivas, does not sound like a record featuring a 17-year-old despite the presence of simplicity and childish innocence in numerous instances. In the mid-1990s, he recorded two albums for Peter Gabriel's Real World label. The first was ‘Rama Sreerama’, an entirely traditional album of Carnatic music. The second one was the fusion project with guitarist Michael Brook ‘Dream’ in 1995. In many ways, this album was way different from the previous one as well as his other recordings. He and his brother, U. Rajesh, have extensively worked on the fusion of Carnatic and Western music. Srinivas’s album 'Floating Point' with John Mclaughlin even received a Grammy nomination.    U. Srinivas was more than a virtuoso musician, since unparalleled artistry expanded the possibilities of the mandolin and, in doing so, redefined the horizons of Carnatic music. His deep respect for tradition and willingness to explore new musical endeavors made him peerless among his contemporaries. Although from a young age, he was internationally viewed as the successor to Pandit Ravi Shankar, he did encounter skepticism from traditionalists who were wary of incorporating a Western instrument into Carnatic music.

But, what if that oracular remark, within a year or two, gets realized and the whole world witnesses the birth and rise of a global superstar of South African music? This is the story of  Brenda Fassie, one of the greatest pop icons of Africa, who emerged from humble beginnings to set out to become one of the most celebrated and controversial figures in South African music. Her life, her career, and her achievements were marked by a remarkable unyielding spirit that resonated deeply with her fans. Born on November 3, 1964, in Langa, Cape Town, South Africa, Brenda was the youngest of 9 siblings. Her mother was a pianist, so it is needless to say that from a very early age, this exposure fostered her passion for singing. By the age of five, she had already started performing with her mother on stage and established her own niche as a vocalist in her town. Tourists were already paying to hear her singing. Moreover, during this Brenda formed her own group called the Tiny Tots, a singing and dancing group that Fassie's mother had founded.  By the age of 16, she was performing in local bands and honing her craft. Her first significant break came when famous producer  Hendrick ""Koloi"" Lebona came from Johannesburg and paid a visit to Brenda. This turned out to be an auspicious beginning of a stellar life and career for her.  Lebona was already aware of her prominence in the local township (which refers to an urban area in Cape Town), as many musicians from Cape Town had praised Brenda’s singing. During his visit, Lenona came to realize that she might be, in his own words, ‘the voice of the future.'  To achieve her dream of becoming a famous, rich and world-renowned singer, she moved to  Soweto, Johannesburg with Lebona in 1981. She was supposed to finish her education before embarking on her journey as a singer. But, soon after she arrived in Soweto, she was recruited in a vocal group Joy, as a substitute for one of its members. Following this came the opportunity to join a township music group called Brenda and the Big Dudes; this time as a lead singer. With this group, she gained recognition for her powerful voice as well as popularity for her uniquely vibrant stage presence.  This group was a backing band for another popular South African duo in its earlier days. Then came young Brenda Fassie and together they released their debut single” Weekend Special” in 1983. The single became the best-selling record of that time–in South Africa with sales of over 200,000 copies. This single brought on international popularity and  Brenda, with her group, went on a tour to the United States, Britain, Europe, Australia and Brazil. Unfortunately, her days with this group were marked. In 1987, they disbanded, and it presented Brenda with a serendipitous opportunity to pave a path for herself as a solo artist.  Throughout the 80s, Brenda was gradually establishing herself as a pop star. In 1987, she released  “Ag Shame Lovey” and her eponymous album “Brenda,” both received positive reviews from music critics and featured a few of her all-time great tracks. This was just the first of the firestorms she was yet to summon. Brenda was also working with producer Sello “Chicco” Twala in the late 1980s. They established a successful endeavor in the South African music industry.  Their album  “Too Late for Mama” achieved platinum status in 1989. Brenda Fassie's impact on South African music and culture is virtually immeasurable.  Her music not only influenced the sound of kwaito ( a South African genre of music) but also paved the way for future generations of artists. It challenged societal norms and gave a voice to the voiceless, particularly in the township communities where she grew up. Her outspoken views and closely knitted friendship with people of poorer townships made her immensely popular. Her songs became anthemic to hope and resilience and symbolized the quest for freedom and equality in post-apartheid South Africa. The song's infectious beat and Brenda's charismatic vocals deeply resonated with listeners. Known for flashy and flamboyant personality and performance, her concerts became legendary. Her music was revered by critics and she was idolized by her fans. However, such immaculate success came with a price. Along with her life as a musician, her personal life and relationships often made headlines.  In 1990, she and her husband, Nhlanhla Mlambo were sued for fraud.  She faced significant struggles with substance abuse as well. Her drug habits jeopardized her music career and she had to be admitted to a drug rehabilitation center.  With the news of her drug and alcohol abuse, her bisexuality also grabbed public attention through frequent coverage of this issue on media platforms. The tumultuous experiences of her life only seemed to amplify her artistry. Her raw, emotional tracks spoke of her battles with love, loss, and identity. She channeled her pain and experiences with utmost honesty into her music. This transparency about her struggles made her a relatable figure. Her relevance and popularity never faded. She went on to win five South African Music Awards for “Best Female Artist” as well as “Best-Selling Release of the Decade”  in 2004, and “Lifetime Achievement Award” in 2005. In 2001, Time magazine solidified her position as a global icon by calling her “The Madonna of the Townships”. Brenda Fassie's journey from the streets of Langa to becoming a cultural icon will serve as an inspiration to many. She will always be the “MaBrrr” to her fans.

The person who belongs to the top spot on the upper echelon of stardom in modern Egyptian music is Umm Kulthūm, often referred to as Kawkab Al-Sharq- literally ""The Star of the East.” She is one of the most iconic and influential singers in the history of the Arab world. The emotion and precision that her voice wielded resonated with millions across the Middle East and far beyond. This is the story of the woman whose voice defined an era and continues to echo in the hearts of listeners worldwide.   Umm Kulthūm was born as Fatima Ibrahim Al-Sayyid Al-Baltaji in 1904 in a rural village in the Nile Delta of Egypt. She grew up in a religious household. His father was an Imam in the village and sang traditional religious songs at weddings and holidays with his son and nephew. She did have a humble beginning and learned singing from her father and brothers through mimicking or, in her own words, by ‘parroting.’ Her father taught her how to recite the Qur'an, and it is reported that she had memorized the entirety of the religious text of Islam.   Upon her father’s request, she joined her family ensemble, although her father was anxious about her public appearance since singing is seen as disreputable, especially if the singer is a woman. She wore a boy's cloak and Bedouin head covering to avoid the opprobrium for performing onstage. Soon, Umm Kulthūm made a name for herself singing in the towns and villages of the Egyptian delta. Her reputation had an exponential rise, so much so that renowned musicians from Cairo took notice of her and she was invited on multiple occasions to perform in the capital city. Eventually, she had become the central figure in her family ensemble.  Those visits to Cairo opened up a new and tantalizing path for her, and eventually, she moved to Cairo. There she learned to play oud, a traditional instrument, from Amin Beh Al Mahdy. It was not her first tutelage under a mentor though, since she had already been tutored on old classic Arabic repertoire by Mohamed Abo Al-Ela, a modestly famous singer. She also trained in poetry in addition to music and imitated the mannerisms of wealthy ladies to elevate her social image since she had been looked down upon in her early days in Cairo.     Umm Kulthūm had to face fierce competition from two prominent singers of that time who had a similar kind of voice to hers. But she had a well-established reputation in private and public venues which led to her first recording by the mid-1920s and, before the end of the decade, she had become one of the most sought-after and best-paid musicians in Cairo. In fact, she was making twice as much money as the biggest names in Cairo. In 1967, Umm Kulthūm made her only performance in Europe at L’Olympia in Paris where she was paid twice what was given to Maria Callas who was an American-born Greek soprano and regarded as one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century. By the 1930s, she had become a role model to young aspiring female singers.  Her career was decorated with extreme success on multiple platforms other than recording and live performances. Such extravagant commercial achievement in recording eventually landed her on radio, film, and television. She made her first motion picture in 1936, Wedad. It was an Egyptian romantic musical film and the biggest production of its time. In her debut film, Umm Kulthūm played the title role and it was the first of six motion pictures in which she was to act.   Her voice was a contralto, an uncommon female voice type, and sang in the lowest register of the female voice. It is also speculated that she could sing as low as the second octave and as high as the eighth octave at her vocal peak. While singing to large audiences in concerts, she performed without a microphone; and showcased her virtuosic improvisation-it was said that she never articulated a line the same way twice. Another spectacular thing was the duration of each song in her live performances. When she sang live, the duration of each song was not fixed as she would repeat verses if she was requested by the audience. Her performances usually lasted for up to five hours, during which, maybe, only three songs were sung. One of her improvisatory techniques she also used to repeat a single line or stance over and over, but with subtle alteration of the emphasis and intensity. This was typical of old classical Arabic singing where singers explored one or various musical modal scales or maqam.  She had created a public persona as a patriotic Egyptian and a devout Muslim and it happened during the turbulent periods of two world wars, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the Egyptian revolution in 1952. She was also known for her generous contributions in support of the Egyptian military efforts. Many known stories underscore the influence she had on national as well as international levels, and a common one goes like this: Umm Kulthūm’s music was taken off the airwaves after Egypt’s 1952 revolution. The national hero of Egypt and later the second Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, upon learning about that, supposedly said: “…Do you want Egypt to turn against us….?”    After living such an eventful and lavish life, at the age of 75, Umm Kulthum died in 1975 from kidney failure. During her monthly concerts, people rushed home to watch her perform leaving the streets of some of the world's most populous cities empty. Such was the case with her funeral. A procession of around 4 million people participated and it became a national event. She truly was a cultural and political symbol of unity and identity for Arabs. Her unparalleled brilliance bridged social divides and mesmerized generation after generation. The legacy left behind by the Star of the East surpasses the boundary of time, genre, and geography.",2024-12-14T19:35:12Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The arid landscape of Egypt has nurtured numerous superstars over the years.

Another spectacular thing was the duration of each song in her live performances. When she sang live, the duration of each song was not fixed as she would repeat verses if she was requested by the audience. Her performances usually lasted for up to five hours, during which, maybe, only three songs were sung. One of her improvisatory techniques she also used to repeat a single line or stance over and over, but with subtle alteration of the emphasis and intensity.

It is instantly recognizable by its catchy beats and intricate rhymes. The cultural turmoil that sprouted hip-hop has deeply embedded roots in the experiences of African Americans. Their struggles against systemic racism, economic inequality, social segregation, and disenfranchisement are where we find hip-hop's origin. From its birth in the urban streets of New York City to its international popularity, hip-hop has always been a powerful voice for not only Black communities but for numerous other minorities as well. It is both a reflection of their struggles and a platform for resistance. Apart from being a genre, hip-hop is a cultural movement with multiple other art forms such as rapping, DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti under its aegis. It is also a reaction to the racial and socio-economic challenges faced by Black Americans. The lyrics narrate the realities of street life, police brutality, poverty, and systemic discrimination so much so that it does not take long to realize how and why hip-hop has established itself as a modern soundtrack to the Black struggle. Hip hop vs Rap Before going further, we should clarify the difference between hip-hop and another term that is often taken to be interchangeable with it, rap. For this, we can start with what hip-hop legend KRS-One summarized in one of his songs, and that is - “Rap is something you do. Hip hop is something you live"". So, rap is a musical style that features an impressive verbal display, often quick, of lyrics and articulation. Whereas hip-hop is a cultural and global phenomenon that incorporates and has influence on many other art forms. It is a lifestyle. All rap is hip-hop. The Roots of Hip-Hop and Black Resistance Now, to understand how hip-hop became the soundtrack of the Black struggle, it is necessary to look into the socio-political conditions that gave rise to it. In the 1970s there was a significant shift in the urban landscape of New York City, especially in neighborhoods like the Bronx. With economic decline and broken social services, Black and Latino communities were engulfed in a vicious cycle of poverty and a lack of opportunities. Amidst such pressing adversities, hip-hop emerged as a form of expression to voice the frustrations of youths and claim their identities. The role of hip-hop was spoken by KRS-One, one of hip-hop's foundational figures, in his 1990 song ""The Bridge Is Over."" In the song, he claimed that hip-hop plays its part in addressing social injustices. The neglect of urban communities by the government has always been one of the central themes of early hip-hop. KRS-One reflected on how hip-hop had become a ""weapon"" for those who were forcibly silenced. Like its parent genres such as blues and jazz, hip-hop was a gateway for the Black community to speak about what they really are and how they truly feel. Early hip-hop pioneers saw their music as a continuation of their fight. It has spread its influence on the Civil Rights Movement or any Black Power movement in general.  Hip-Hop as Political Commentary Hip-hop culture was ignored or outright criticized by politicians from the very onset of the 1980s throughout the 1990s. The unapologetic stance on political and social issues is a key feature that distinguishes hip-hop from other genres. ""Public Enemy,"" a group widely known as one of the most politically charged in hip-hop history, is a prime example of this. Their album ""It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back(1989)"" features songs that call for social and political revolution and critique media misrepresentation of Black people. The rise of gangsta rap showed significant overlap with political and conscious rap and brought issues like poverty, police violence, and drug addiction into the mainstream media. What the pioneers of the gangsta rap genre started doing was blending the crime stories, violent imagery, and aggression associated with gangsta rap with socio-political commentary. Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. are two of the artists who became cultural icons as the Black community could connect to the harsh realities of inner-city life they portrayed in their songs. Tupac’s music, in particular, became synonymous with political activism.  Hip-Hop and Global Impact Hip-hop has spread rapidly around the world owing to mass communication which allowed the creation of a global culture where hip hop can flourish. With the power of media, Hip-hop has played a significant role in amplifying the voice of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. The compatibility of hip-hop and BLM is not mere coincidence, since both movements emerged from the same long-standing frustrations with police violence, systemic racism, and the marginalization of Black people in American society. Protesters adopted hip-hop music as a form of resistance and also a way to bring attention to their cause. While hip-hop is considered an American genre, the themes of resistance, empowerment, and struggle were bound to resonate with a universal audience. That is exactly what happened, especially in countries that are devastated with similar racial or political issues. For instance, in Brazil, hip-hop has become a tool for youth to challenge the unfair socio-political structure of that country. The rap crew Racionais MC has taken the spotlight in the country’s Black movements, much like Public Enemy was in the United States. Indigenous rapper Briggs, together with Trials and A.B. Original, has become a prominent political hip-hop artist in Australia. Australian hip-hop artists focus on racism, xenophobia, as well as the issues of climate and gender inequality. In Iran, due to ongoing human rights violations, Iranian rappers are incorporating contemporary social and political issues in their music. However, most of the Iranian rappers are living abroad now, since criticizing the government and social issues is considered illegal in Iran. Final Words Hip-hop's journey from the streets of the Bronx to the global stage is a reflection of the never-ending struggle of Black people in America and around the world. As long as the struggles of any community persist, so will hip-hop's unweaving stand against it. And for millions of people, hip-hop will continue to be something more than music; it will be a testament to the incessant fight for equality.",2025-02-21T16:00:12Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""3gkr1565"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""joerd563"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""d717d4_fa24f96d47af4e5993d4d606601e3fa1~mv2.png""},""width"":1401,""height"":934}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""p91ly566"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""k3jni435"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Hip-hop has become a dominant form of art in the music industry globally.

A vast landscape is usually assumed to have an endless stretch of barren lands, but this could not be further from the truth. It is far from being lifeless or devoid of natural beauty. Hailing from this country, Ganbaataryn Khongorzul is a traditional long-song singer who, on the global stage, embodies the rich heritage of her nation. As a celebrated vocalist, she carries forward the legacy of her culture in her very own way. With her touch, Mongolian folk songs have become a noteworthy genre in our contemporary music world. Khongorzul was born in the Khentii Province. Her journey into music began very early in her childhood. It was deeply inspired and influenced by Mongolia’s rich culture and, of course, the strong bond with nature. Growing up in a country where music is an integral part of daily life, it was not surprising for her to be exposed to traditional songs and melodies. Although during adolescence she only sang for private entertainment, with her innate talent, she was soon encouraged to pursue music.  Khongorzul specializes in a style of singing called ""khoomei"" (throat singing) and she is famous for ""long songs"" or ""urtiin duu"". The name ""Long song"" is not only because the songs are long, but also due to the longer duration of each syllable of text while singing. The main feature of the long song is the ""shuranhai"" which prolonged and held notes with deeply modulated vibrato, particularly on the vowels. Another key feature is the accompaniment of the unique and exquisite Morin Khuur, a two-stringed traditional instrument that has been cherished by the Mongols for as long as they’ve lived. UNESCO declared the Mongolian Long Song as one of the ""Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity"" in 2005. The long song has the qualities of being profoundly philosophical and meditative in character. It unmistakably illustrates the spacious mountain valleys and a sense of peace and tranquility, regarded as the representation of the Mongolian soul. As mentioned before, Khongorzul preferred to sing only in small groups or private settings. However, when she auditioned for the Than Khentii Folk Ensemble, she was accepted. Following that, in 1998, she started attending the University of Culture and Art in Ulaanbaatar. She won the first prize in the Ulaanbaatar Competition of Professional Long Song Singers in the same year.  Khongorzul was becoming well-known at an astonishingly rapid pace. Wherever she stepped on, she won the stage over with immaculate victory. She was a soloist singer with the Mongolian Theater of National Dance and Folksong,  also known as the Great Theater of National Arts— a theater that performs traditional Mongolian folk songs and dances.  and the Traditional Music and Dance Theater both in Mongolia and abroad. With this theater, she traveled abroad to perform, and this is how she made a name for herself internationally.  Khongorzul had arguably the biggest success with The Silk Road Ensemble. It is a musical collective that is a part of Silkroad—a not-for-profit organization, initiated by cello virtuoso Yo-Yo Ma. This project took inspiration from the historical Eurasian Silk Road trade routes. Khongorzul has been featured on ""Silk Road Journeys: When Strangers Meet (2002)."" The track is called ""Mongolian Traditional longsong."" The album was admired by both listeners and critics. It was adventurous, inspiring, and stirring. The album does evoke a sense of curiosity about the Silk Road's cultures. Khongorzul’s music is unique in the sense that it has an uncanny ability to transfer listeners to the vast, open landscapes of Mongolia and conjure up images of rolling hills and galloping horses as well as the timeless traditions of nomadic life. Her performances are musical acts that connect audiences to the soul of Mongolia.  Both Khoomei or throat singing and long songs inherit the spiritual significance of its birthplace. These are often performed during rituals, ceremonies, and festivals. Khoomei is believed to mimic the sounds of nature. The sound of the wind, the rivers, and the animals all are infused and a harmony between humans and the natural world emerges. On the other hand, long songs are a reflection of Mongolia’s nomadic heritage. Khongorzul's renditions embody the very essence of the folk tradition.  Khongorzul's scope to flourish and widen her artistic horizon came in the form of collaborations. Apart from the Silk Road Ensemble, she worked on multiple collaborative projects and performed on many famous stages of the world such as Carnegie Hall, Hollywood Bowl, Suntory Hall, Albert Hall, Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow Concert Gebau, etc. She had the honor of singing for the opening of the Nobel Prizes and the opening of the 2002 Fifa World Cup.  Khongorzul has used these platforms to raise awareness about the importance of preserving cultural heritage and to celebrate the richness of Mongolian culture in its own right. Such a role as a cultural ambassador was bound to take her to some of the world’s most prestigious stages. And she attended many events arranged by major organizations including the United Nations and UNESCO.  Khongorzul has spoken about the spiritual dimension that music takes her to. It is a form of meditation in a way, and it has the power to connect a practitioner with the divine. For her, singing is not just a profession; it is more of a calling from her ancestors. Her music is a tribute to honor her ancestors and a vessel to share their wisdom with the world. Through her voice, Khongorzul has brought the spirit of Mongolia to the land of mortals, nurturing a deeper appreciation of her country’s heritage. Khongorzul Ganbaatar is capable of quavering and swooping vocals in the most natural way that touches the core of the human soul. From her motherland to the land of other cultures, she has been an iconic musician on numerous platforms. Her presence exudes the sheer pride she has in her ancestry and heritage. Her music and musicianship are worthy of a higher level of reverence and it would stay that way in the years to come.",2025-03-06T19:00:00Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""aod51668"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""am24i666"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""d717d4_d48ec74070404602a57b3c3ccee4d7b2~mv2.jpg""},""width"":170,""height"":170}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""0n1dx669"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""0g3r6422"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Mongolia, home to one of the earth's coldest deserts, boasts an exquisite musical history that stands apart from other regional traditions owing to its deep connection to the country’s nomadic culture.

11,"In the picturesque landscapes of present Japan, tradition intertwines with modernity in a perfect tandem. This country has adopted modern...",4,[],FALSE,japan-s-last-goze-haru-kobayashi-1,,"In the picturesque landscapes of present Japan, tradition intertwines with modernity in a perfect tandem. This country has adopted modern sensibilities only after molding them in such a way that befits its culture, tradition, and values. This was a collective endeavor for sure. However, it does not disprove the fact that some key figures stand out among others. The last Goze Haru Kobayashi is one of these outstanding figures in the Japanese Goze tradition. As one of the last surviving Goze, she represents a unique form of artistic expression and also a way of life that is tied to the socio-economic changes in Japan. Before diving into the life of Haru Kobayashi we need to look at what being a goze means. The Goze were blind women musicians who traveled across rural Japan, particularly in the regions of Niigata and Toyama, during the Edo period. They are often marginalized due to their disability. Historically, the Goze emerged from the necessity of having economic independence. Many women were forced into this profession due to societal pressures and limited opportunities. These women became adept performers of traditional music, using the shamisen—a three-stringed instrument. The Goze not only entertained but also served as preservers of oral traditions and storytelling practices through song. Haru was born in a small village in Niigata Prefecture in 1990. She was the youngest among four siblings in a relatively opulent household. She could have had a comfortable life with her family, but fate had something else planned for her. At three months of age, she lost her eyesight. There was no known way to recover her eyes. Her family feared the societal pressure that Haru have to face all her life. Two years later, her father died and her mother was unable to take care of her children. So, Haru had to be brought up by her great-uncle. Social stigma for blind people in that period jeopardized Haru's chance for a normal life in society. A blind woman could not have more than a handful of choices for her career. Haru's family decided on her becoming a goze. She was assigned to receive her training under Fuji Higuchi. Haru was given the goze name ""Sum."" Subsequently, she took her first step into the world of Goze at a young age. Her mother had always been horrified of what Haru's fate had to unfold. As a mother, she had to prepare her daughter for the harsh reality of the society. She grew progressively authoritarian to Haru. Fearing her mother's punishment, she relentlessly practiced on the shamisen, which she started learning at the age of 7, disregarding her bleeding fingers. On the banks of the Shinano River, she would practice Kangoe, a vocal style specific to goze, in thin clothes. She was cold and her throat bleeded, but Haru could not stop. Her mother showed motherly emotions to her daughter in a few instances. In one of these events, she cried after learning how Haru's friends pointed out her inability to distinguish between colors. When a goze is allowed to play duets, it symbolizes her becoming a ""true' goze. Haru became a true goze at the age of 13. But, Fuji Higuchi, was not impressed with her. She would often berate Haru for her seemingly unskilled singing.  Unlike Fuji, Haru's another mentor, Sawa Hatsuji of Nagaoka, was readily captivated by her skill as a goze. In 1995, Haru cut ties with Fuji and went under the tutelage of Sawa in the goze organization of Nagaoka. She wholeheartedly praised Haru on her technique and etiquette. This nurturing environment helped her develop a deep understanding of the art form. And at the same time, she began appreciating the stories and emotions of each piece. During this period, Haru showed tremendous growth in terms of her skills, moreover, her condition was improving as well. As a result, finally, she was about to become a fully-fledged goze.  After Sawa's death, Haru studied under Tsuru Sakai with whom she shared a warm friendship. Haru took over Tsuru's goze group after her retirement and stayed with her even after becoming independent. Haru announced her own retirement in 1973. She parted with her shamisen and gave it to one of her apprentices.  Before her retirement, the popularity of goze was already declining l, as television was gaining its appeal in Japan. Near the end of the twentieth century, goze was going through its waning days. But, Haru still retained her popularity among the crowd. She was tailed by television reporters to a church she used to pay frequent visits to. Haru continued her work and was hopeful that this art form can find its relevance in contemporary culture in Japan. She felt that there was still a future for Goze if proper support was provided. Haru emphasized the need for awareness and education.  Following her performance at Kokugakuin University in front of an audience, including the scholars of folk arts, she once again came into the limelight of the media and general masses. The education committee of Shibata city wanted  to record the goze performances. They chose Haru for this task and retired Haru resumed performing. This way goze culture was reintroduced to Japan, especially to younger generations of Japan.  In 1977, she was staying in a special home for the aged, and was united with former gozes who had worked in the region. In the same year, Haru was declared as the preserver of goze activities and in 1979, she was given the ""Medal with a Yellow Ribbon,"" one of medals of honor that the Japanese government awards to the person who is hard-working and a model for the people. Haru Kobayashi’s life and work is a bridge between past and present. As one of the last Goze, she had to carry the weight of her tradition as well as embody the hope for its survival. In an era where cultural heritage often finds itself at risk of being replaced and faded away from the collective conscience of people. Haru’s journey reminds us of the beauty and significance of preserving our collective history.",2025-01-25T00:09:50Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""In the picturesque landscapes of present Japan, tradition intertwines with modernity in a perfect tandem.

His unparalleled contribution to Indonesian music, youth culture, and collective social conscience through his music and lyrics has earned him the title “the Voice of the People.” This is not surprising if you consider that he is of Javanese descent, which is the largest ethnic group in the region. As a result, he has historically dominated the social, political, and cultural landscapes and narratives of Indonesia and Southeast Asia as well. In 2002, Time called him a ‘Great Asian Hero.’ It was indeed a reflection of his uncanny ability to capture the aspirations, frustrations, and dreams of the common Indonesian people. In this article, we embark on a journey against the arrow of time–to the past–and witness the ascension of Iwan Fals from his busking days to the throne of the king in the Indonesian pop scene and eventually becoming the pride of the nation. Early Life and Music Virgiawan Listanto was born in Jakarta on September 3, 1961, and later became ‘Iwan Fals,’ as the son of Haryoso (a soldier) and Lies Suudijah. If we were to stop our time machine in Iwan's earlier years, we would bet our money on him becoming a world-class athlete. Iwan Fals is well–trained in multiple styles of martial arts, such as karate, silat, and judo, and also played sports like football, basketball, and volleyball. In fact, he was the 4th Place Winner of National Karate in 1989. Honing the spirit during these years, Iwan fought his whole life, but it was the art of music that was his true weapon. His musical career began at school in Bandung, where he started busking. Iwan’s friends usually covered songs by the English rock band  Rolling Stones, however, Iwan was more willing to play his own songs. Adhering to his principle of “looking at life simply”, he composed funny songs with humorous lyrics, and it made people happy. “No matter how bad the song is…it is my own creation,” said Iwan. This principle, or sentiment, or whatever it might have been, still guides his work as a musician. What's in a name?  Iwan’s stage name, “Fals,” which is a shortened form of falsetto,  was actually a joke made by his former “manager” and busking companion Engkus, a motorcycle repairman and workshop owner. He told The Rolling Stones magazine that he kept this to protect himself from performing badly. The Rise of Iwan Fals The first group he formed was “Amburadul” while he was 18. They recorded two albums but had to disband since their released album ""Perjalanan"" in 1979 and the subsequent re-release in the following year was not successful. To support himself and his family, Iwan had to keep on busking. It was 1981 when he signed to Musica Studio and recorded his first solo album, “Sarjana Muda” (Lit. “Bachelor Degree”). This album showcased Iwan’s signature country music style for the first time, unlike his previous albums. Finally, he was on his way to mainstream music of Indonesia, and his music was about to charm his countrymen.  “Sarjana Muda” was in great demand following its release, and that resulted in Iwan being offered to sing for audiences and on TV shows. After 1987, he stepped into the world of television, and his songs, such as Oemar Bakri, were aired on TVRI, an Indonesian national public television network and one of Indonesia's two national Public Broadcasting Institutions. By this time, Iwan had stopped busking after the birth of his second child . Songs For Social Change What set Iwan Fals apart from his contemporaries was his ability to speak directly to the common people. His straightforward but poignant lyrics spoke of the challenges faced by ordinary Indonesians; their unfulfilled dreams and desires for a better life echoed in Iwan’s songs. Such resonance to the masses was instigated by a simple guy in glasses with his simple guitar accompaniment but emotionally charged delivery of each word.  Take the protest song “Guru Oemar Bakrie,” for example. It portrays the life of a teacher who is poorly paid but still holds himself responsible for educating future well-paid and successful people. In Indonesia, Guru Oemar Bakrie became a very well-known character and it popularized Iwan’s name as well. Or, 'Galang Rambu Anarki' from the 1982 album Opini established Iwan's reputation as a protest singer as well as a balladeer.  This song celebrated the happy event of the birth of his first child but also criticized rising prices.  Political Repression and Personal Struggles Iwan’s music was not politically conscious in his early days, his songs tackled mostly romance and mundane issues. However, as a poet and as an artist, he could not turn a blind eye to pressing issues in his country. After getting a wider audience, he started creating politically-charged music.  In 1984, the song “Mbak Tini” (Miss Tini) was about a roadside prostitute who married a truck driver and put him under house arrest for two weeks. The problem was that the name, Miss Tini,  could also refer to first lady Tien Soeharto. Iwan’s outlaw reputation went on a rise following the arrest, many even compared him to Bob Dylan. His songs became the anthem for the anti-New Order government movement. Iwan had been fearless, undeterred by the constant threat from the ruling regime. But in 1997, his son Galang, who had just started his own band, died from an apparent overdose on drugs. This was something that left Iwan broken, so much so that he even stopped writing and performing music.  With the support of his family and the birth of his third child, Rayya Rambu Robbani, after a gruesome struggle with his own self, Iwan came out stronger and finally got over the loss of his son. But, he had changed a lot. His long hair and his style– all gone. The only thing that did not change was his unbreakable spirit. Final Thoughts Iwan Fals is a true rebel; his music and life both reflect that. Recently, he has decided to go indie. His albums can directly be purchased at the store at his Leuwinanggung home or make an order at his website . It might slow down his album sales; he is aware of that, but this is his attempt to stop his album from being pirated.  Once every month, Iwan holds a free acoustic concert in his residence. It is a spectacular amalgamation of his fans from different eras of his forty-five-year-long career. What's more astonishing is how relevant Iwan and his music are even after more than four decades. This is a textbook example of resilience. He will undoubtedly continue to inspire social changes through his music, which has cemented his place as one of the greatest musicians in Indonesian history.",2025-05-02T15:59:05Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""udncj394"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""ofekv392"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_51d9d88e960f45cda43122e401b11c23~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1280,""height"":853}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""ht9l9397"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Today, we will talk about an Indonesian singer, guitarist, songwriter, and activist, Iwan Fals, who “chose life and did things with a light heart.\"" His unparalleled contribution to Indonesian music, youth culture, and collective social conscience through his music and lyrics has earned him the title “the Voice of the People.” This is not surprising if you consider that he is of Javanese descent, which is the largest ethnic group in the region.

""King"" refers to his...",4,[],FALSE,king-sunny-adé-from-nigerian-roots-to-global-fame,,"King Sunny Adé was born on September 22, 1946, in Oshogbo, Nigeria. His real name is Sunday Adeniyi Adegeye. ""King"" refers to his position, ""Sunny"" comes from Sunday, and ""Adé"" comes from his family name Adegeye. He is one of the major contributors responsible for the internationalization of Juju music. It is impossible to overestimate his influence on the global and Nigerian music scene. From a young musician in Nigeria to a Grammy-nominated performer, his journey demonstrates a commitment to fusing traditional sounds with contemporary influences, leaving a legacy that inspires musicians everywhere. This article explores the life and legacy of King Sunny Ade. Sunny was born into a royal family in Ondo State, Nigeria. Sunny Adé was a Yoruba Omoba(Oba is a pre-nominal honorific for kings in Yorubaland who was born in Osogbo) to a Nigerian royal family from Ondo and Akure. Maria Adegeye, his mother, was a trader, and his father played the organ in a church. However, in the Yoruba culture, royal family members were traditionally prohibited from performing music. Sunny's passion was further fueled by his exposure to his father's gramophone at home. When he was five years old, he would follow vans that were selling goods because he was enthralled with the music that was playing on their megaphones. His father’s collection of records was quite diverse. So exposure to different kinds of music was there to fuel his creative expression. He recalled having records labeled as “GV”. He memorized songs without understanding their meanings. But as his family was not in support of his learning music he had to choose an alternative path to learn music. So he joined the Boys Brigade. Even though the Brigade's band played a variety of instruments, such as trumpets, bass drums, and snare drums, Sunny Ade was most captivated by the snare drum. He would follow the snare players through town from morning till evening, frequently without food or water during army parades.  He went to Saint Charles Grammar School, the Methodist School, and the African School in Osogbo.  But in 1962, he moved to Lagos and Abeokuta to get out of family bindings to pursue his passion for music. Claiming to be on his way to the University of Lagos, Sunny Adé left grammar school in Ondo City to begin his musical career in Lagos. He started his career with the highlife group Federal Rhythm Dandies, led by Moses Olaiya. But he left the band. King Sunny Adé founded his own band, the Green Spots, in 1966 after departing Moses Olaiya's Federal Rhythm Dandies. This choice marked the beginning of a revolution in Nigerian music. His single ""Challenge Cup"" sold over 500,000 copies in just two weeks in 1969. In an interview, he said, “How do I make a hit record? I don’t know.  And I said to myself “I will make a record to praise them because they won the Challenge Cup.” Before they can play another Challenge Cup, they are going to keep that Cup for the next two years. So when they immediately won the Cup, I just sent a record in praise of them. So all the fans have to buy the record. So that’s my first hit.” Adé changed the band's name to African Beats between 1973 and 1974 because the cigarette company Green Spot wanted to use the group for marketing. Adé, who stayed away from smoking, decided to distance his band from the cigarette company and adopt a more Pan-African identity. He expressed,  “Cigarette company came to promote Green Spot cigarettes. And I don’t smoke. How will I promote a cigarette? So I intentionally changed the whole band name to the African Beats. And when the band broke off in 1985, then I changed to King Sunny Adé and his New African Beats.” Over the years, Sunny Adé's band changed their name several times before settling on ""Golden Mercury"". In 1982, Sunny Adé's band set out on a tour of Europe, and North and South America. Throughout the tour, he gained recognition for his dancing skills and guitar playing, which were influenced by Tunde Nightingale. He decided to do this in an attempt to stand out from other Juju practitioners. King Sunny Adé became one of the first African musicians to receive substantial international recognition when he signed with Island Records in the early 1980s. His albums, Synchro System (1983) and Juju Music (1982) introduced juju music to audiences around the world. In 1984, he became the first Nigerian artist to be nominated for a Grammy for his album Synchro System. He was influenced by I.K. Dairo and Tunde Nightingale. “I.K. Dairo is more or less like a father to me. He is my role model, he is one of my greatest inspirations. He’s someone that I love so much and I have so much respect for him. Until when he was being laid down into the hole when he died, I didn’t believe he was a human being. I thought he was a saint. Because from the onset I loved his music and I appreciate his music so much. And that’s a part of my music you can hear – the maracas in my music, it’s there”. But adding his own touch he said, “I’d been playing with a group that plays like I.K. Dairo for years before I formed my band. And then I said “Where will I go? I want to find my own identity.” So I decided to copy Tunde Nightingale. So, nobody copies Nightingale… except me. Now, I said to myself, “If he’s playing open-chord, I have to find my own way. I don’t want to sound as a copycat.” He became the first African to receive two Grammy nominations in 1988 with his collection of traditional Yoruba songs, Odu. Using the Yoruba art of praise singing, Adé infused his lyrics with traditional wisdom and life lessons. King Sunny Adé has supported healthcare and education programs in Nigeria through his non-profit organization called the King Sunny Adé Foundation.

In today's modern world, music is more diverse and, somewhat, more inclusive than ever before. However, what continues from our caveman ancestors till now is the mark of identity that each musical tradition bears. Any tradition of music is founded on the unique traits of a culture and ethnicity. Throughout our history, in the face of subjugation and discrimination under a certain dominant cultural model, a downtrodden culture has resisted the impending blow on their way of life. One of the modes of such resistance is music. How music becomes a means for opposing aggression and subjugation can be found in Zimbabwe's tumultuous history of independence. And the person who was at the forefront was Thomas Mapfumo, the protagonist of our story, whose musical journey has mirrored the path of independence of Zimbabwe, from colonial oppression to independence. Born in 1945 in former Southern Rhodesia, Thomas Mapfumo is a Zimbabwean musician and composer who catalyzed the independence of his country through the popularity and power that his music wielded. Shona music and its tradition have been an integral part of his life. He grew up in a family that follows rural Shona traditions. He was particularly influenced by the mbira, a traditional thumb piano, which plays a crucial role in Shona culture. At the age of 10 Mapfumo moved to Harare with his family. Here, he experienced Shona music in a new light along with American rock and roll. His interest grew as he listened to various genres. The amalgamation of influences from all of these genres eventually led him to his own musical style. He began his musical career at age 16 with a band called the Cyclones (or Zutu Brothers, according to some other sources). He joined as a singer in this.  In his early days as an artist and a performer, Mapfumo worked with some other bands, mostly as side gigs. Among these bands, The Wagon Wheels is a popular mention with Afro-jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi (known for his ""tuku music"") and guitarist James Chimombe. A major shift occurred in his life and his music when he joined the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band. With this band, he truly started incorporating influences from Shona in his composition. Until then, he was mostly doing covers of songs by artists such as Otis Redding or Elvis Presley.  The music associated with the religion and spirituality of the Shona people of Zimbabwe is known as Shona music. Other than the usage of instruments, like mbira and hosho which are quintessential to this tradition, the inclusion of dancing and active participation of the audience themselves are unique to this style. Traditional Shona music has been adapted to modern instruments such as electric guitars and western drum sets. And Mapfumo was a pioneering figure in this new endeavor. He transcribed the sound of mbira to electric guitar with a guitarist. During the early 1970s, Zimbabwe was ruled by a minority of white individuals. They held a pejorative view of the native black population and culture. By adhering to his culture and vocalizing his people's struggles and suffering, his music was taken as statements against established political structures. Mapfumo's songs were affecting the revolution of black Zimbabweans who were beginning to resist the white minority government. He coined the term chimurenga for his style of music. The word is derived from the Shona word for “struggle.” The lyrics were written in the language of the Shona people and incorporated traditional melodies and rhythms into his music. With his band the Acid Band, he released the first album in chimurenga style, titled ""Hokoyo!"" The Rhodesian government banned this album and Mapfumo was thrown into a prison camp without charges in 1979. But, as it turned out they could not stop all the radio stations from playing this record. A protest and demonstration arose in support of Mapfumo's release and he was freed after three months.  Following Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, Mapfumo celebrated with his people for the newfound freedom, but the disillusionment came very soon. Mapfumo became increasingly dissatisfied with the Zimbabwean government and released the album Corruption(1989) with his band the Blacks Unlimited, criticizing President Mugabe and his government. He began to address issues like corruption, economic decline, and human rights abuses in his music. This criticism led to further tensions with the government and subsequently to his exile in the United States in 2000. Mapfumo’s expulsion did nearly nothing to erase the existence of his recordings in his homeland. His latest songs were still banned in the state radio stations of Zimbabwe, like the albums Rise Up(2005), Exile (2010) and Danger Zone (2015). No wonder, these albums were equally poisonous to the government like his old ones. He continued to prove the importance of his music in the national discourse and the socio-political issues that were plaguing the country under Mugabe's reign. Thomas Mapfumo is an influential figure promoting Zimbabwean culture and identity. His work has inspired a new generation of musicians and activists who continue to use art as a means of advocacy. Mapfumo's songs remain relevant as they reflect the ongoing struggles of the Zimbabwean people and the broader African experience. Mapfumo had established himself as an irreplaceable contributor to music and social justice. His influence can be seen across all the following generations that came later. His popularity and the power of his music were held at an exponential rise. So, when he returned to Zimbabwe in 2018 following Mugabe's overthrow in 2017, he performed in a huge show in front of an audience of thousands at Glamis Arena in Harare and it was named ""Homecoming Bira.""

With the enchanting sounds of the kora, a 21-string harp-lute native to West Africa, this Malian legend of the kora, who delighted in performing with musicians from other traditions and countries, has upheld the culture of his native land on the face of the earth. Diabaté hails from a long line of griots, or jail, who are traditional storytellers, historians, and musicians in West African culture. His mastery of the kora has earned him international acclaim, making him one of his generation's most influential African musicians. The London-based newspaper ""The Independent"" named him ""one of the fifty best African artists"" in 2006. This article explores Diabaté’s life, musical contributions, and his role in preserving and modernizing West African tradition On August 10, 1965, in Bamako, Mali, Toumani Diabaté was born into the Diabaté family which boasted a lineage of griots that dates back over 70 generations. This family had an unusually large number of members who had a high aptitude for music. His father, Sidiki Diabaté, was a kora virtuoso and celebrated as one of the first to record the instrument in the 70s. His mother was a singer and his younger brother was a kora player as well.  Growing up in a family with a history of nearly two centuries-long oral tradition, the griot culture made it impossible for him not to become fascinated with music. Diabaté learned from watching his father and grandfather play, but his father's style left a deeper impression. By thirteen, was performing on stage with other prominent griot artists.  The kora itself is a unique instrument, and its history goes way back. The earliest known reference to this instrument can be found in the 1300s by the famous traveler Ibn Battuta. Kora combines elements of a harp and a lute. It consists of a large calabash gourd covered with cowhide, a long hardwood neck, and 21 strings that are plucked with the fingers. The instrument is significant in West African culture, often used to accompany oral histories, praise songs, and spiritual rituals. The kora is not just an instrument for the people of this region, for them, it serves as a bridge between the past and the present. In the late 20th century, an electric model of kora called the ""gravikord"" was invented. The Malian government had always supported the local traditions. In 1987, Diabaté made his first appearance with a group from Koulikoro at the age of 13, before joining the group backing the singer Kandia Kouyaté when he was 19. But, when the broadcaster and music academic Lucy Durán visited Bamako to find musicians for a festival of 1987 Music of the Royal Courts, Diabaté saw his breakthrough coming.   His first album, a timeless classic, Kaira (1988) introduced Toumani, and, of course, the kora, to a Western audience. It was produced by Durán and recorded in one afternoon during his visit to London where he stayed seven months. What sets apart Diabaté’s music, or works as his hallmark, is how he was able to blend traditional Malian melodies with contemporary influences. This aspect of him made his collaborations with musicians as diverse as it could get. For instance, take a look at his partnership with Spanish flamenco guitarist Ballaké Sissoko on the album Djelika (1995). It is often claimed to be a masterpiece of cross-cultural collaboration. Diabaté collaborated with the American bluesman Taj Mahal on Kulanjan in 1999. This album was praised by President Barack Obama as well. He released The Mandé Variations (2007), a solo kora instrumental and a proper follow-up to Kaira. All of his collaborations underscore Diabaté’s technical prowess for sure. However, what is also highlighted is his commitment to creating a global dialogue between all the people of this world. Diabaté’s national and international fame and generational talent changed the fate of Kora. Its image and popularity successfully convey the message that people recognize the connection between ancient and modern music that Kora creates. Diabaté has played a crucial role in realizing this future in the face of globalization and modernization. Cultural preservation has always been a driving force for his music. Arguably, his most notable project is the group called Symmetric Orchestra. The orchestra fuses traditional Malian instruments with modern ones. This project is both rooted in tradition and forward-looking. The group’s long-awaited album Boulevard de l’Indépendance (2006) is a testament to Diabaté’s vision of a united Africa. For a visionary musician like Diabaté who dreamed of unifying the globe through music, he had surely put out myriads of remarkable albums. Now, we are going to take a look at some of them  Kaira(1987)  is Diabaté’s debut solo album and also the first-ever solo kora recording in history. It was a fitting album to introduce his extraordinary musicianship. In the Heart of the Moon(2005),  with Ali Farka Touré, won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional World Music Album in 2006. The interplay between bluesy guitar and kora is both earthy and transcendent.   The Mandé Variations (2008)  is considered one of Diabaté’s most ambitious works. This solo album features improvisations on traditional Mandé themes. It is a modern classic in terms of skill and creativity.   ""In the Heart of the Moon"" and ""The Mandé Variations"" both won a Grammy for   Diabaté’s innovative approach to the kora. But, the Grammy was not the only award he has bagged in his career. Diabaté has been honored with the prestigious Chevalier de l’Ordre National du Mali, one of Mali’s highest civilian awards. This recognition nothing but reflects his immense contributions to Malian culture.  While striving to erase the line between the past and future, he has inadvertently begun to remove the cultural exclusion. He showed that it is possible to share the spirit and essence of one's culture without sacrificing authenticity. This would be passed down to the coming generations as his legacy. Toumani Diabaté led a life that is tantamount to that of a prophesied hero. His mastery of the kora and his dedication to preserve and bring in a revolution in West African traditions has reshaped the face of world music before, and will continue to do so. This is a textbook example of the unfathomable power of music.",2025-04-18T15:59:03Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""8mumo470"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_bc7b21474d634cdabad662e7a47cb741~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1365,""height"":2048},""altText"":""Toumani Diabaté: The Maestro of the Kora""}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""k3bc7473"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""LEFT""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""LEFT""}},""style"":{},""id"":""6cgxl370"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Toumani Diabaté and the rich musical heritage of Mali are synonymous.

Without a doubt he is one of the most influential musicians from South Africa and his music was vibrant and distinctly rooted in African tradition. Africa and African people had invariably been in Masekela's mind wherever he went. His music and activism, even after being exiled, revolved around his land and his people moreover, the voice of the common people. In this article, we will dive into the remarkable life of Hugh Masekela and how he became a global symbol of resilience, a voice for the oppressed, and an ambassador for African music. Hugh Ramopolo Masekela was born on 4 April 1939 in Witbank, near Johannesburg, South Africa. He grew up with the urban and traditional sounds of South Africa. This exposure laid the ground for Masekela's musical endeavors and inadvertently, he was drawn to music living in such an environment. He tried his hands on trumpet at the early age of 14.  His first exposure to the trumpet came when he saw the film ""Young Man with a Horn,"" featuring Kirk Douglas. Hugh's father Trevor Huddleston noticed the budding curiosity in Masekela and gifted him a trumpet. Unbeknownst to him, from this moment till his death, this very trumpet will become his source of courage and means of resistance.     Acquiring a trumpet kindled his passion for music, at the same time, it also set him on a path to becoming one of the greats of his time. At that time, the Huddleston Jazz Band was the first youth orchestra in South Africa and Masekela joined the band with his father's encouragement. It didn't take much time before it was apparent that he had a talent for trumpet. He quickly began to make a name for himself in the local jazz scene. In 1959, he founded Jazz Epistles, which was the first African jazz group to record an LP. Apart from Masekela, there was another future star, Abdullah Ibrahim who participated in this band. Together they incorporated African musical traditions with the bebop sounds of American jazz; this might have been Masekela's most crucial step in his search for a unique and vibrant sound. With his peers, the father of South African jazz could envision a prosperous music career, but behind the scenes, something insidious was about to happen. In 1960, the people of South Africa witnessed one of the first and most violent demonstrations against apartheid in South Africa known as The Sharpeville Massacre. Masekela realized that his music could not flourish under such an oppressive apartheid regime and he had no choice other than to leave South Africa. In 1960 with the help of Huddleston and other supporters, he fled to London. This changed the course of his life, whether for better or worse it was yet to be known.   His journey took a serendipitous turn when he traveled to the USA and attended the Manhattan School of Music. Here in Manhattan, Masekela was exposed to an unimaginably broad spectrum of musical and political influences. And now, he could immerse himself in the vibrant jazz scene where he studied classical trumpet and had the chance to play alongside legends such as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, and Miles Davis. Masekela's rejuvenated life in the West started with auspicious incidents. Following those events, his first breakthrough came in 1968 when he released his version of ""Grazing in the Grass"".""Grazing in the Grass."" It grabbed everyone's attention and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The success that came with this song also brought him global fame. This was the catalyst that established him as a significant figure in the jazz world.     Despite his moniker the Father of South Africa’s Jazz, he has always been aware of his true self as a musician and exhibited a commendable inclination to push against this superficial definition. With that mindset, he went on to collaborate with musicians from around the world. He had seen a diverse range of artists when he was in the USA, like jazz greats Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, and John Coltrane, and even worked with pop icons like Paul Simon. But when it came to producing his own music, without skipping a beat, he took the life in South Africa’s black townships as his muse. It is true that he left Africa in the 1960s, but Africa never left him, even for a moment. He also became involved in the civil rights movement during his stay in New York and saw the uncanny similarities between the struggles of African Americans and black South Africans. Masekela's music didn't serve mere entertainment to his listeners, rather it was his form of protest against oppression and apartheid. For instance, songs like ""Bring Him Back Home,"" was a tribute to Nelson Mandela and was one of the popular anthems of the anti-apartheid movement.       After the fall of apartheid and the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990, Masekela returned to South Africa. His long-awaited return was the end of three decades of exile. He carried on his live performance and recording albums, mentored young musicians, and actively participated in the renaissance of South African jazz. As a cultural ambassador, he promoted African heritage and identity. Finally, the South African government recognized his contribution to music and his stance against apartheid. Following the recognition, he received numerous awards and honors which included the Order of Ikhamanga in gold for his excellent achievement, from the South African government. Hugh Masekela's remarkable life spanned for nearly eight decades. He saw the world crumbling down and saw the emergence of a new world out of the pile of rubble. He dedicated his life to pursuing music and social justice for the people of Africa. His music is his documentation of these events that he went through and till the end of his life, he stood proud with his head held high.

Although he was not recognized as much in his early endeavors, as time went on, he slowly became the heartbeat of Kazakh culture and identity. Even in the face of adversity, the Kazakh composer is marked by his musical innovativeness, and his way of life shows devotion.Shamshi Kaldayakov was born on 15th August 1930 in the Shaulder village of the Otyrar region of the Turkistan Region formally known as the South Kazakhstan region. His parents from the Younger Zhuz, one of the three traditional tribal confederations or hordes (Zhuz) of the Kazakh people, named him Jamshid Donbaiev. But his family and friends used to address him as Shamshi, which relates to warmth and inspiration which is quite fitting for Kaldayakov’s later contributions to Kazakh music and culture. His father was a blacksmith but used to play the Kazakh instrument Dombra and created his own poems and music to play. His mother used to like music too and sang along to his father's Dombra. So it was natural for young Shamshi to get involved in music by learning mandolin quickly and composing his first song.In  the early 40s, Shamshi Kaldayakov ran away from home and school during World War II in artistic pursuit. He changed his family name from Donbaiev to Kaldayakov to evade the police. During this period he worked as a tractor driver. Both the Kazakh Famine of 1930–33 and World War II greatly impacted his artistic expression. After the war, Shamshi returned to studies and continued his agricultural work. He enrolled in the Kaplanbek Veterinary Technical School. After his graduation, he served in the army in Sakhalin. Then in 1955, he entered a music school in Tashkent. Later moved to Almaty, formally known as Alma-Ata to study composition at the conservatory. The same year he moved to Alma-Ata, in 1956 the conflict regarding grain fields between the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic under First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev escalated. This inspired Shamshi to compose music for the poem ""My Kazakhstan"" (Kazakh: Menin Kazakhstanym) by poet Zhumeken Nazhimedenov. Zhamal Omarova sang to Shamshi’s music which became popular in Kazakhstan via the radio stations across the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan. Against Shamshi and Zhumeken’s wishes, politicians used the song for their agenda. The song was renamed ""The March of the Virgin Lands"" and repurposed to support Khrushchev’s Virgin Lands campaign to increase agricultural production by transforming vast areas of Kazakh steppe into farmland. Despite his talent and dedication, he struggled with formal education and was unable to complete his degree. His success was not supported by the music conservatory in Alma-Ata. In 1959 he had to leave the conservatory because of his “wrong harmony”. This lack of formal credentials was the reason he was excluded from the Union of Composers. He applied three for the Union of Composers of Kazakhstan. But they refused.However, the youth of Kazakhstan loved the mix of Kazakh folk songs and legends and the rhythm of the waltz. His music became silently popular also across the borders of Kazakhstan. His songs like “Kuanysh waltz”, “Kaidasyn”, and “Baқyt Kushaғynda” made him the “Father of Kazakh Waltz”.  In 1957 his mother felt that she was going to pass away soon, and called him back from Almaty.  She said to him, “Dear son, it would seem that God did not commit me to see my daughter-in-law and enjoy my grandchildren. Perhaps, it was just a destiny. I have only one wish for you, be healthy! May your new, emerging song never be interrupted, be happy, my son!”. To which he responded, “Mom, I can’t promise you that I will set up a mausoleum for you, but I will dedicate to you the most intimate and tender of songs. And, it will never be forgotten!”. This event gave birth to “Song about Mother” in 1961. In 1965, Kaldayakov became a Laureate of the National Youth Prize. The teacher of Shamshi, Vasily Velikanov, referred to him as a polyphonic multi-voice song master. During a 1969 meeting in Paris with French President de Gaulle, Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan First Secretary Kunayev became aware of Shamshi Kaldayakov's music and upon returning to Alma-Ata gave him the keys to a brand-new three-apartment building in the city. Even though he took the apartment, he gave it to a friend with a large family living under poor conditions. During the 60s and 70s, he composed over 300 songs. His compositions, ""Ak erke - Ak Zhaiyk"", ""Arys Zhagasend"", ""Syr Sului"", ""Teriskey"", ""Karkaraly"", and ""Omir Rukh"", have depicted the beauty of the Ulyn steppe. Throughout his compositions, his appreciation for the pastoral beauty and the cultural heritage of Kazakhstan is rooted in his early professional endeavors. During the 80s he suffered from illness. He dedicated a number of his favorite songs to his wife, Jamila, who also shared his passion for music. Together, they brought up two sons who continued his musical legacy. Shalkar became a famous pianist, and Mukhtar went on to become a conductor at the Abay Opera House. It wasn't until the last few months of Kaldayakov's life that his contributions were acknowledged. He lived to see his song, ""My Kazakhstan"" become a symbol of solidarity during the 1986 Kazakh youth uprising against the Soviet Union. Two months before his death on February 29, 1992, at the age of 61, he was named the People's Artist of Kazakhstan. Only at this stage  Posthum the Union of Composers of Kazakhstan added him as a member. After Kaldayakov's death, he was honored in his hometown of Shymkent with sculptures, streets, and a park named after him. Shamshi's World Park is a cultural landmark with a Walk of Fame honoring singers who came after him. In 2006, the song ""My Kazakhstan,"" which symbolizes his enduring bond with the Kazakh people, became the national anthem of Kazakhstan. To this day his songs are performed by Kazakhstan’s pop stars, Rosa Baglanova, Rishat Abdullin, Bibigul Tolegenova, Rashid Musabayev Zeinep Koishibayeva, and others. Kaldayakov has lived a humble life. But his legacy will live in the heart of the music of people from Kazakstan. His music has been infused with the soul of Kazakh culture. And his song, “Menıñ Qazaqstanym” is part of Kazakh Identity. There is no doubt that he will inspire the musicians worldwide.

From somniferous lullabies to thunderous battle cries against oppression, music flows through the veins of our very existence. Such metaphors do bear the risk of sounding too abstract, however, the genesis and evolution of blues and jazz, as musical genres, paint a different picture. Blues and jazz are way more than forms of mere entertainment. They powerfully symbolize cultural tenacity, as both genres emerged from the struggles and experiences of African Americans and reflect the history of slavery as well as segregation. This article explores how blues and jazz contributed to the roots of Black resistance and offered a means of escape and self-expression. The Birth of Blues: A Sound Born from Struggle Blues is deeply intertwined with the experiences of Black Americans, particularly in the South. The origin can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, during the enslavement of Africans. Most of the blues musicians had predecessors from Africa who were brought to America in the slave trade and were forced to work on plantations in the southern states of America, and factories in the northern ones. Many of the best-known blues musicians were from the South, and for this reason, it is argued that the Mississippi Delta was the birthplace of the blues.  In his book ""The History of Jazz,"" music historian Ted Gioia writes, ""Blues was a way for African Americans to express their pain and frustrations in a world that often ignored their humanity.""  The distinctive use of the 12-bar structure and “blue notes” carry the emotional weight of the genre and the lyrics dealt with personal and societal hardships, such as love, betrayal, poverty, and injustice. Blues singers like Bessie Smith, Robert Johnson, and Muddy Waters were not only skilled musicians but also remarkable storytellers who documented the realities of Black life in a segregated America. In a broader sense, blues was tantamount to a passive resistance. Jazz: The Soundtrack of Black Liberation Another crucial form of Black resistance jazz emerged from ragtime, blues, and other musical influences such as European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, and work songs with a bigger ensemble of instruments. It developed in the early 20th century in New Orleans before spreading across the country. Being nurtured in the multicultural setting of New Orleans and a blend of a multitude of familiar and famous genres, it was the first true American genre that achieved global recognition. Jazz was a more improvisational form of protest in contrast to blues, where the latter was often focused more on personal expression of pain and survival. A myriad of subgenres were developed over the following decades after its inception ( Kansas City jazz, gypsy jazz, bebop, modal jazz, and free jazz, for example), and all these eventually led to jazz fusion and Afro-Cuban jazz. By the mid-20th century, jazz had become way more inclusive than anyone could have ever imagined. Jazz stands as a stark contrast to the structured forms of Western music with its improvisation as a form of self-expression. In one way,  improvisation can be seen as a metaphor for Black resistance. In the 1920s, during the Harlem Renaissance, jazz became a symbol of Black intellectual and cultural empowerment. Figures like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Billie Holiday used jazz to convey both personal and collective experiences. Blues, Jazz, and Resistance to White Supremacy Martin Luther King Jr. said that “jazz speaks for life. The blues tells the story of life’s difficulties…This is triumphant music.” Black people were marginalized and dehumanized by the society which was dominated by white people. Both blues and jazz were the counterpoints to the narratives of white supremacy. These provided a pathway to reclaim their humanity and burst out of the racist structures that were there to limit their opportunities. One among many bold ways in which blues and jazz musicians upheld their resistance was through their presence in the entertainment industry. The early 20th century was a time when Black artists were often downplayed for their ""race music."" It was a way of keeping them and their art away from mainstream media. However, jazz greats like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington severed these barriers by their musical genius, and also by the cultural significance they had at that time. Of course, this was not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. According to biographer Allan Keiler, contralto Marian Anderson was invited to sing in Washington by Howard University as part of its concert series due to her international reputation. But the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), a lineage-based membership service organization for women,  owned the hall and they refused to allow her to use the hall because she was black. Moreover, there was a white-artist-only clause printed in every contract issued by the DAR. Moreover, both blues and jazz had strong ties to the civil rights struggles of the 20th century. Artists like Nina Simone, John Coltrane, and Sam Cooke used their music and voiced the demands for equality, justice, and freedom. Nina Simone's ""Mississippi Goddam"" was her ""first civil rights song"" which was banned in several Southern states. Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" is another example of how music serves as a much needed tool for protest and activism. Such revolutionary songs had directly addressed the frustrations and hopes of the Civil Rights movement. The Enduring Legacy of Blues and Jazz in Black Resistance The search for identity among African Americans was taken upon by Jazz musicians before any modern essayists and scholars wrote the racial identity as a problem. Today, blues and jazz continue to remind us of the unabated and ongoing struggle for racial justice and freedom. It can be said without a doubt that the civil rights movement achieved significant victories. However, the cessation of systemic racism still remains elusive in many aspects of society. In the 21st century, blues and jazz have morphed into something more complex and widespread yet they retain the essence of their true purpose. On top of that, genres like hip-hop have inherited this raging desire of liberation from blues and jazz aiding in the pursuit of pushing the boundaries of Black artistic expression and social commentary.  Final Words I cannot imagine a future where music has ceased to play a crucial role in resistance movements. Blues, jazz, or anything derived from these will serve as integral cogs that run the story of Black resistance forward. These genres will continue to inspire and influence artists today as beacons of hope and courage and signify that the ongoing struggle for freedom shall be fought with music.",2025-02-28T16:59:07Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""mmpjf614"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""zhaoa612"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""d717d4_a6b5580ea9864ac2a6c9ea8a4447ef49~mv2.jpg""},""width"":800,""height"":578}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""leayj615"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""uhlep509"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Music has been a vehicle for our individual and collective expression of joy, grief, rage, and even defiance.

It emerged from the struggles of communities in the Afro-Caribbean and became the very soundtrack of anti-colonialism across Africa and the Caribbean. The wave of reggae swept over South Africa as well, in fact, the rhythmic and thematic aspects of reggae are strongly associated with Africa, so much so that it has been called ""the quintessential African musical form"".  In the African and, also, in the global music scene, South African reggae musician and Rastafarian Lucky Dube is venerated as a pioneering musician of this genre. He is one of the best selling African musicians, and his music has always been the embodiment of the soul-piercing nature of reggae. This article will take you through the chronicles of Dube's life—from his birth to his ascension to the throne. Early Life: Roots & Struggles Born into a Zulu family at a farm on the outskirts of Ermelo, a small town in the west of Johannesburg, Dube grew up with his grandmother since his mother had to move from place to place in search of a job. He credited his grandmother for being the one who made Dube the person he was.  The son of a Zulu mother and an estranged father from the Swazi ethnic group, Dube's early life was harsh. The unforgiving realities of apartheid, racial segregation, and discrimination enforced by the government had marginalized South Africans to a horrifyingly extreme degree. He had to go through poverty and starvation as food was often extremely rare. To sustain themselves, Dube and his two siblings fed on the soup made by their grandmother from sheep's droppings. Musical Beginnings and Breakthrough The macabre grip of the apartheid era made Dube experience firsthand how everyone around him was deprived of opportunities and economic stability. So, when he was working as a gardener in his early years, he attended Jan Rell High School, where he formed the Skyway Band, his first musical ensemble.  In 1983, Dube moved to Madadeni, a township on the outskirts of Newcastle, and joined ""the Love Brothers"". This group was led by his cousin and performed in the mbqanga, a style that blends soul and pop with traditional Zulu music. He released multiple albums with this group and his cousin, such as ""Lucky Dube and the Supersoul,""  a Afrikaans album ""Die Kaapse Dans"" in the Afrikaans language, and the EP ""Help My Krap"". All these records were gaining traction among his native audiences.  Rise to Fame and Musical Evolution In his school years, Dube became aware of Rastafari, an Abrahamic religion that developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. It was a response to colonialism. Also, systemic oppression and racial inequality were brought along with it. Reggae became a form of expression of Rastafarian spirituality. Dube did not consider himself a Rasta in the traditional sense; he only embraced aspects of the faith, such as vegetarianism.  Dube noticed that his reggae songs resonated with his audience during concerts and realized the potential impact reggae might have in the sociopolitical commentary of South Africa. With that in mind, in 1984, he released the first reggae album, ""Rastas Never Die"". Unfortunately, this mini album did not perform well and was banned by the regime due to its critical lyrics. But Dube was indomitable; he kept on performing the reggae tracks live and released a second reggae album, ""Think About the Children,"" in 1985. This time, it did not miss the mark and achieved Platinum sales status. His sophomore album established Dube as a popular reggae artist in South Africa and caught the eyes of people outside his homeland.  Reggae: A Tool for Change Dube's incorporation of African rhythms and reggae became his trademark, recognized by audiences both in his country and abroad. His adoption of reggae was not accidental; rather, he had a clear and stern reasoning behind it. Much like Marley, Dube used his music as a platform to speak out against the injustices faced by South Africa’s black majority. One of his most famous songs, ""Together As One"",  yearns for unity amidst division and segregation. Other songs, such as ""House of Exile"" and ""Different Colours, One People"", strongly inherit the essence of Dube's music and philosophy. His immaculate storytelling upholds the necessity of racial harmony and equality and was propelled by his personal experiences under apartheid. Global Recognition of a Pioneer Dube's international recognition and success were merely a matter of time. One after another, he was putting out albums that brought in both popularity and money. He became a household name with the release of ""Slave"" in 1987. Two years later, he released his double-platinum album ""Prisoner"". Shortly after, he started performing in Europe and the US for the first time. He was the first South African artist to appear at Jamaica's Reggae Sunsplash. The performance and the stage presence he showcased in these concerts resulted in a headline spot for the international segment of the following year's event. His reputation as a musical pioneer was known by the whole world, and he had broken through the barriers of race and geography by this time.  The Twist of Fate Lucky Dube's life was tragically cut short on October 18, 2007. A musician, who was walking tirelessly on his path of regaining freedom and justice for his people, was murdered in a carjacking incident in a suburb of Johannesburg, Rosettenville. The shockwaves were felt throughout the music world, and his passing left a void in the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Epilogue  Lucky Dube was recognized not only for his exceptional musical talent but also for his role in promoting peace, unity, and social justice through his art. In remote Aboriginal communities of Australia, he is known for being ""Bigger than the Beatles"". It would be an understatement to call him a global star. Only those who have been touched by Dube's unfiltered raw emotions can feel it in their soul what Lucky Dube was. The empty throne that he left would surely find another worthy king who would bear Dube's legacy on their shoulders. He once sang, ""The truth is an offense, but not a sin."" Lucky Dube's truth will keep on resonating and inspiring new generations to carry the torch of freedom and equality.",2025-03-21T16:00:53Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""f1oix515"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""93yfa513"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_4ea360a5b29c4f77b9677e40fdd98a9f~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1024,""height"":797}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""dx6ji516"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""q4g0z391"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Originating in Jamaica in the late 1960s, reggae has been a sharp voice raised against colonialism and imperialism from its birth.

It has never been a mere medium for entertainment; the hopes, dreams, and even regrets of the masses are what drives musicians in making music and draws people. However, for many artists, such an act of creating music becomes the catalyst that forces them into exile and leave their country and their people. To escape persecution, unethical censorship, or violence, musicians often move beyond borders, and many of them end up reshaping their lives and career by channeling personal loss into songs which eventually become anathematic to revolution and resistance. Their stories reveal the crux of indomitable urge of  creating a piece of art; and that is “art survives everything.” It is fascinating how exile redefines someone's identity, and how melodies possess uncanny ability to shake the foundation of authoritarian regimes.  This article dives into the lives of musicians in exile, how it influences their craft, brings in substantial changes in their homeland’s cultural landscape, and tears down fallacious political narratives. Fleeing Homelands Amidst Turmoil Being exiled is almost never a choice for anyone. Riddled by incessant political misappropriation and ruthlessly oppressive regime, musicians unwillingly leave their own home and settle in a foreign country. In most of the cases, they are left with no other options since their music has become a liability.  Take the example of Victor Jara, a Chilean director, poet, singer-songwriter and political activist. His works are quintessential in developing Chilean theater and his music   became synonymous to Salvador Allende’s socialist movement in the 1970s. Gos songs became synonymous with Salvador Allende’s socialist movement in the 1970s. Following the coup of Augusto Pinochet that toppled the government, Jara was assassinated for his music’s political potency. In Iran, music is heavily censored, so much that to thrive the underground rock scene has to operate in secrecy. Iranian artist Mohsen Namjoo, who is known as “the Bob Dylan of Iran,” and whose music is a unique blend of ancient and contemporary sounds, was arrested for blending Persian poetry with bluesy critiques of theocracy. After being charged with “insulting Islamic sanctities” in 2009, Namjoo fled to Europe, where he continues to produce music banned in his homeland. While we are at it, I would like to mention another musician, Masha Alekhina of the Russian punk collective Pussy Riot, who kind of represents a generation of Russian artists who have fled abroad to escape imprisonment for challenging Vladimir Putin’s regime. In April 2022, she fled the country disguised as a delivery driver after the announcement of her sentence to time in a penal colony. The Sound of Displacement All three of the stories that we came across so far do have one common thing among them. It is the hypersensitivity to criticism. Paired with insatiable greed for power of government. This is usually the primary factor for most of the cases of exiling. Governments equate music with subversion, thus for a musician exile becomes the price of truth-telling. Cut off from their roots, musicians deal with nostalgia for their country apart from alienation in their new home. For these reasons, they feel the urgent need to redefine their place in the world. This often ignites and fuels an artistic evolution. In a way, exile fractures identity. For “Fela Kuti”, Nigeria’s Afrobeat pioneer, exile was crucial. After releasing ""Zombie""(1976), where he critiques Nigeria’s military government, soldiers raided his commune, beat him and threw his mother from a window. Fela had to flee to Ghana but returned months later, his music fiercer and more politically charged. His sound—a fusion of jazz, funk, and Yoruba rhythms—had become a weapon, inspiring pan-African solidarity.   In Fela's case, being exiled had created hybridity. However, in contrast, Syrian pianist “Malek Jandali” took his exile as an opportunity to preserve cultural heritage. Born in the “capital of revolution,” Homs, Syria, which was one of the worst-hit areas during the three-year Syrian conflict. Surviving a 2011 attack, Jandali relocated to the U.S. His music reimagines ancient Syrian melodies with orchestral grandeur. It is his personal grief and a plea for peace.      But, unfortunately not all transformations are redemptive. Many artists lose their career and identity after being exiled in a foreign country. Even if they made a name for themselves again, their music becomes a dialogue between memory and reinvention—a search for belonging in the dissonance. As Cuban legend “Paquito D’Rivera,” who defected to the U.S. in 1981, described exile as a “spiritual amputation.”   Reshaping a Nation’s Musical Identity Exiled musicians rarely fade into silence. Rather, their work often transcends borders which influences not only the country they reside in, but also their homeland’s cultural trajectory from afar.  Artists are always more sensitive to their inner self as well as their environment. If exiled, it can only be imagined how deeply they might experience every emotion from fear to sadness. They cannot ever sever their ties with their homeland and their people. They still feel the need to do something for their fellow countrymen. Following the ban of “Miriam Makeba” by South Africa’s apartheid regime in 1960 for testifying against it at the UN, she became a global icon. It was quite the opposite of what the oppressive regime wanted or anticipated. Her hits like Pata Pata  introduced the world to African rhythms, while her activism kept horrors of apartheid regime in the spotlight for every pair of eyes of the world to see. Though banned from her country for three decades, Makeba’s music kindled and supported the anti-apartheid movement, proving that exile could amplify a message rather than stifle it. Epilogue: The Unsilenced Exiled musicians are more than refugees—they are archivists of memory and they have an immaculate ability to fight their trauma, and be the architects of change. The said change is not necessarily for their own sake, in majority of the cases, it is for the sake of their people, and their collective hopes and dreams.  Their songs are the touchstones, forged in the crucible of displacement, that challenge the notion that mere borders can contain ideas. From Fela Kuti’s defiant and raucous music to the whispered tone of underground Syria ballads, their music transcends geography, turning exile into a bridge between the silenced and the free.",2025-05-30T16:56:59Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""VIDEO"",""id"":""9d5wa918"",""nodes"":[],""videoData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""video"":{""src"":{""id"":""video/ef9da7_030a993091f74783add1a8f35a7ef65a/720p/mp4/file.mp4""},""duration"":45.098},""thumbnail"":{""src"":{""id"":""media/ef9da7_030a993091f74783add1a8f35a7ef65af000.jpg""},""width"":1680,""height"":720},""title"":""Songs Behind Silence_ Musicians in Exile.mp4""}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""cc3jy921"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""zon2t788"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Music is akin to a mirror to society, culture, and ideology which reflects the engraved joys, struggles, and revolutions.

Lalon Shah, or Lalon Fakir, is a 19th-century spiritual leader, philosopher, mystic poet, and bard whose songs continue to be an inseparable part of  rural Bengal. 
 The songs of Lalon aim at an indescribable reality way beyond realism. He spoke of what he  observed; he spoke of day-to-day problems in simple yet moving language. This article is all about Sufism and Lalon Fakir, and how his music and philosophy influenced the structure of Bengali culture. 
 The Rise of Mystical Thought in Bengal Culturally, Bengal had a rich confluence of Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and tribal cultures which set the stage for a mystical and spiritual tradition like Sufism. But, by the 18th and 19th century, under colonial rule, big changes were about to come in. During this time, Bengal was undergoing great political, religious, and social shifts. And Lalon emerged from this complex landscape, but not from some scholarly or aristocratic family, rather from a community where oppression, discrimination, and poverty were realities. 
 Mystical traditions in Bengal often blurred the boundaries between religious identities. Sufi saints, Bauls (wandering minstrels), and Bhakti poets all contributed to a somewhat singular tradition where inner devotion is the priority, not ritual. In their mind, human equality was more desirable than hierarchy. Lalon inherited the essence of Baul and Sufi traditions and turned them into songs with deep and philosophical lyrics. 
 Lalon’s Life and Mystical Awakening Lalon Shah’s early life shares a similarity with his music and philosophy—mystery. His earlier years are shrouded in legend. On one hand, some accounts say he was born a Hindu where others claim he was a Muslim. However, what is generally accepted is that he fell seriously ill once, during a pilgrimage. His companions left him behind but a muslim family rescued him and nursed him back to health. This event became the point where Lalon came face to face with the contrived and phoney boundaries that society and religion have created. 
 Returning home, Lalon was met with rejection by his community for living in a muslim house. This ostracization finally broke the barrier down for him. After that he never went back to any fixed religious identity. He had the calling of universal mysticism and embraced it. He settled in Kushtia, where he established an Akhra —a spiritual and cultural space where music, philosophy, and social reflection thrived. 
 The Core of Lalon’s Sufi Philosophy In Lalon's mind spirituality and humanity both are different sides of the same coin. His songs resonate with this philosophy and, so, these songs sound deeply spiritual yet humanistic. He often explored the idea that the divine is present within the human being. He takes the “self” as the key to understanding the divine. In his world, the dichotomy between the material and the spiritual, and between the body and the soul do not exist. 
 Through questions, Lalon tore off the ostentatious veil of organized religion. He exposed the hypocrisies of society and religion as well as the ploy to divide and control people. Lalon emphasized love, tolerance, and wisdom; Lalon rejected blind adherence to scripture. His songs challenged both Hindu Brahmins and Muslim clerics. Lalon was non-sectarian in this regard. 
 Music as Medium of Protest and Reform Lalon was unbiased in terms of both compassion and critiquing religion. Every religion, every organization and every human were the same in his eyes. And his music reflects that , and that is why Lalon songs are widely popular among both Hindu and Muslim communities due to their non-sectarian spirits and universal urge. 
 Such inclusiveness was bound to make his music a powerful tool for social critique. During British colonialism, when caste-based discrimination and communalism were rising, Lalon's songs were the counter-narrative for human dignity. 
 He sang in the language of the common people of rural Bengal which ensured that his messages reached everyone. His bold declaration of  the meaninglessness of caste and ritual, the oppression of women, and the absurdity of communal divisions could be understood by all. Needless to say, for authorities his music was something to be wary of. 
 In one of his songs, Lalon challenges the obsession with external appearance by saying, 
 “ They say the body is impure, but where will you live then? ” 
 This line puts emphasis on the concept that the body is a vessel of the divine. Lalon believed that the body, when respected and understood, becomes the means of spiritual realization.  Lalon’s Influence on Bengali Culture and Music Lalon’s songs are revered by countlessly more people who do not belong to the spiritual community; his influence stretches far beyond. Many folk and classical artists have interpreted his songs. Among them is Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore was influenced by Lalon's philosophy so much so that he even introduced urban elites and international audiences to Lalon's music. 
 After the abolishment of colonial rule in Bangladesh and West Bengal, Lalon became a symbol of resistance, reformation and cultural identity. His music was a source of motivation and power for Bengalis. During subsequent political unrests, his songs were the glue that united communities and formed  resilience against oppressive authority and government.  
 Epilogue “Everyone asks, ‘What religion does Lalon belong to?’ 
 Lalon says, ‘ I’ve never found the answer .’” Lalon’s songs are still a source of much inspiration for Bengalis and also anyone who is in search of their purpose in this world. He offered us a  journey which is spiritual as well as revolutionary.  
 Lalon Shah  is an icon of Bengali culture who inspired many poets and thinkers who came later. His legacy is not just his songs, it also includes the awareness he invited us to raise for both ourselves and our societies.",2025-07-25T15:58:10Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""lh34n480"",""nodes"":[],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""type"":""VIDEO"",""id"":""nc5zx1675"",""nodes"":[],""videoData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""video"":{""src"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/-s0S7-3xah4""}}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""dgmot1678"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""\n"",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""\"""",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}},{""type"":""ITALIC"",""italicData"":true}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""If there’s no caste in birth, where does it come from?\"""",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700},{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}},{""type"":""ITALIC"",""italicData"":true}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""RIGHT""}},""style"":{},""id"":""gz8uz482"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""–"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}},{""type"":""ITALIC"",""italicData"":true}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Lalon Shah"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""type"":""PARAGRAPH""},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""y0qfz485"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The path of Sufism is rooted in love, humanism, and unity.

With a nurturing sea and a harsh mountain as guardian deities, it is the homeland of the Kabyle people, known for its vibrant culture and traditions. A monumental figure in Kabyle music and Amazigh culture, a singer-songwriter and musician,  who was soon to be referred to as the ""King of Amazigh music,"" was born nearly seven decades ago. This article is dedicated to this musician whose lyrics are nothing short of poetries, whose voice is akin to a calm ocean yet shakes the stern mountain. This is the story of Idir, one of its most cherished ambassadors of Berber or Amazigh music. Idir was born in Aït Yenni, Tizi Ouzou Province, part of former French Algeria, on 25 October 1945 as Hamid Cheriet. Raised in a family that valued tradition, Idir was exposed to the music and oral poetry of his ancestors from a young age. The region of Kabylie is a historically significant area in Algeria. The people have a deep-rooted heritage and not only that, they had to bear the curse of colonialism and political repression. Their language and culture were marginalized by the predominantly Arab culture of the Algerian government. Both the nourishing culture and more than a century-long struggle against oppression influenced and eventually shaped the artistic vision of Idir. This background, apart from molding his worldview, served as inspiration for his lyrics, which often reflected the themes of identity, nostalgia, and social issues. Idir, oblivious to what his fate had in reserve for him, pursued studying geology and to establish his career path, he worked in an oil and gas field. In this petroleum field, his musical proficiency didn't go unnoticed. Despite his nonchalance towards becoming a professional artist, in 1973, he substituted for Nouara, an Algerian singer, on Radio Algeria. He performed  ""A Vava Inouva"", a lullaby composed by Idir with Ben Mohamed  incorporating the ""rich oral traditions"" of his Amazigh culture and was inspired by a traditional story about “a young girl trying to save her father from danger.”  This song was written for Nouara, but she refused. Left with no other choice, Idir interpreted it himself, sang it on the radio, and went on with his involuntary draft for military service, unaware of the aftermath of his song. The lullaby song was an immediate success. Moreover, it might arguably be the best-known song in the Kabyle language internationally as well as an unprecedented commercial hit. Here, it should be mentioned why Idir chose this  stage name during his performance of  ""A Vava Inouva.” During the epidemics in Algeria, there were neither doctors nor hospitals for medical care. There were times when children were dying as soon as they were born. In hope for their children’s survival through the epidemics, parents named them “Idir,” a kabyle name which means “He lives.” After returning from his mandatory military service, he was surprised by the success and praise his song had received. He realized the extent of the power that his music held and the responsibility of becoming the voice of his people and his cultural heritage that he was bestowed upon. During this time, Idir was contacted by the record company Pathé Marconi as well, and he knew what he had to do. With a more refined sense of the journey he had to embark on, in 1975, he set out for France to work on his debut album- A Vava Inouva. On this album, we can hear his signature sound featuring traditional Kabylian flute and darbouka. In Idir’s own words, the title song, “A Vava Inouva”  had chosen him. Maybe it really did, considering the success it brought him and how it was translated into seven languages.  Following his sophomore album  Ay Arrac Nneɣ in 1979, Idir took a long hiatus from music. He felt unsatisfied with the show-biz and his stage performances. And for more than a decade, all he did was perform for a few recitals. But, in 1991 he released a compilation album with 17 tracks from his previous albums. This was named A Vava Inouva, the same as his debut album and, of course, features his greatest song “A Vava Inouva”. This album also features other successful songs, such as ""Azwaw"", ""Zwit Rwit"", ""Ssendu"" and ""Cfiy"".  The Amazigh song  ""Zwit Rwit"" has an Arabic version,  covered by prominent Algerian Rai singer Cheb Khaled. Idir’s true comeback to the music scene occurred when he released a new album Les Chasseurs de lumières.  This album had characteristic compositional traits like the utilization of the derbouka, flute, and guitar and poetic lyrics on love, freedom, and exile. But, it also had a modernized sense of composing which is evident from the incorporation of synthesizers. After the release of this record, he became a revered figure who advocated the Kabyle and Berber cultures through his form of art. In his 2007 album, La France des Couleurs ( meaning “France of Colors""), Idir contemplated the diversity of the identity of all French people, multiculturalism, and immigration. After releasing his final album, Ici et Ailleurs (meaning ""Here and Elsewhere""), he returned to his native Algeria.  Idir started performing in his homeland with renewed vigor after being practically exiled for 38 years. His concerts were flooded with his native fans. His concerts were much more than mere entertainment for his admirers, these were his way of supporting different causes. He shared a stage with his friend, singer Khaled, in a concert for peace, freedom, and tolerance. Idir participated in a concert held in memory of the Kabyle singer Lounès Matoub, who, along with Idir, was considered as an unstoppable force against the oppression of the Kabyle people. Adhering to his pride in his national identity, he organized a fund-raising concert in support of the population in Kabylie amidst the anti-government riots that were taking place in the predominantly Berber region. In retrospect, Idir had always been a cultural ambassador for the Kabyle people.  He has inspired a new generation of musicians to explore their heritage and encouraged them to take pride in their identity and tradition. He was a valiant human being who instilled the idea of preserving the diversity of culture and stood against the insidious rush of our society to homogenize the whole world and turn it into a gray soup of modernity.

12,Drums of Defiance: The Djembe’s Role in West Africa’s Fight for Freedom,5,[],FALSE,drums-of-defiance-the-djembe-s-role-in-west-africa-s-fight-for-freedom,wix:image://v1/ef9da7_31ca5ff1ab8a4228b816b2d2b1c119b3~mv2.jpg/ef9da7_31ca5ff1ab8a4228b816b2d2b1c119b3~mv2.jpg#originWidth=1267&originHeight=1558,"The djembe, a traditional West African drum, is a perdurable musical instrument known for its powerful and sophisticated sound. Shouldering the burden of possibly a millennium-long history, this instrument remains as a tightly knit rope that ties numerous cultures from faraway lands to their customs and heritage. Born from the hands of skilled blacksmiths and shaped by a chain of shifts in traditional values, with each strike, it speaks a language beyond translation, yet retains its ability to call people together in joy, in mourning, and in celebration.  The Origins of the Djembe The origin of the djembe dates back to 1230 AD, when the Mali Empire ruled millions of people from nearly every ethnic group in West Africa. Geographically, what remains of that empire today is the parts divided among the modern-day countries of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, and Senegal. It is generally believed that the djembe originated from the Mandinka caste of blacksmiths, known as “Numu“ of the Mali Empire. Also, the way the Numu people migrated during the first millennium AD explains the wide dispersion of the djembe drum throughout West Africa. The name ""djembe"" is quite interesting. It is derived from a phrase of the Mandinka language, ""Anke dje, anke be,"" which literally means or translates to ""everyone, gather together in peace."" This phrase beautifully reflects what purpose the drum was intended to serve — bringing people together. So, naturally, the djembe was an integral element of communal gatherings, from births, harvest festivals, and weddings to funerals. This membranophone was also linked to the spiritual ceremonies, a fact that emphasizes its sacred role in West African society. The djembe has a goblet-shaped body or shell carved of hardwood and untreated rawhide is commonly used to make a drumhead. The tension in this animal skin produces an unusually loud sound for its size. Djembe and Communities  The djembe, both in the past and at present, plays a multifaceted role in the West African community in addition to being a musical instrument. The djembe's music summons people to significant gatherings, festivities, and group projects in many villages. The drum's rhythms promote harmony and a feeling of purpose.  Community gatherings often feature music sessions, and djembe remains at the center of it, where everyone, regardless of age or skill level, can participate. These gatherings are entertaining for sure, but simultaneously serve as a means of communication and collaboration and, in doing so, reinforce their collective identity. As a result of having such ties to a culture, learning to play the djembe requires more than just mastering rhythms; a djembefola (who plays djembe) must have a well-rounded understanding of the historical and cultural contexts of the music. Djembe & the Fate of West Africa Anyone who has familiarized themselves with the history of West Africa is certainly aware of the periods of immense struggle, including colonization, slavery, and the degradation of traditional cultures. Incessant aggression against their core values has forced them to build resistance. Djembe has been crucial in their pursuit of preserving their roots and identities. The Slave Trade During the transatlantic slave trade, millions of West Africans were forcibly taken from their homelands and transported to the Americas. They were often prohibited from practicing their traditional customs, which, of course, included music. They wanted to play music, but plantation owners banned all percussion instruments as they thought that drums might be used for secret communication. Separating slaves from their culture was a deliberate effort to make them more subservient. Fortunately, the rhythms and techniques of the djembe survived in such a predicament. Many instruments that were developed further down the line inherited the legacy of the djembe. In this way, the djembe remained a silent presence in the struggle for freedom. The Djembe and the Anti-Colonial Struggle  The driving force behind the slave trade was colonialism. The need for labor in European colonies of the Americas and the Caribbean led to the transatlantic slave trade and the macabre chronicles of oppression that followed.  As traditional practices, including drumming and dancing, were getting banned, African communities stood sternly against it and refused to let their culture die. With the progression of their resistance, the djembe was turning into a sharp tool that would end up aiding in curving out the path for freedom.  A Symbol of Post-Independence Identity The djembe's popularity skyrocketed in a post-independence cultural renaissance in the mid-1950s when African countries were reclaiming their long sought independence. In countries like Mali, Senegal, and Guinea, the djembe was, and still is, the emblem of African unity and pride.  However, uprooting the pillars of oppression in one's own land is different from breaking out of the insidious psychological barriers of colonialism in one's mind. Post-colonial society often finds it difficult to bring down such suffocating walls of the lingering influence of the past. Traditional arts play an essential role in asserting the uniqueness of a culture and the identity of its people. For West Africa, the mighty djembe took up this responsibility.  The Djembe in Modern-Day From the Black Lives Matter to grassroots movements across Africa, one of the unchanged elements is the djembe. How the djembe continues to resonate with communities or individuals, even today, is a telltale indicator of the unabated relevance of djembe. In as early as the 1950s, the djembe was not known to many beyond Africa, apart from some music enthusiasts or those who grew up with it. Many legendary djembeayers toured around the world and earned reverence for themselves as well as for djembe. One of those pioneers is Fodeba Keita of Guinea, who brought a tour of Les Ballets Africains around the world.  Although European countries were the first to take notice of djembe and it became more popular there, Germany, China and also Japan have seen a new wave of interest in it. The surge of appreciation for the djembe not only points toward a well-deserved recognition but also towards its uncanny ability to blend perfectly with many other styles of traditional music which developed in an entirely different environment. This proves the immaculate reverence that this instrument has accumulated in the preceding eras. Final Words  The djembe is fascinating both in terms of the powerful sound it produces and the history it retains within itself in a cryptic language of its own. The only way to make sense of this language is to willingly immerse oneself in the vibrant, rich, and engrossing tradition of this instrument. It stood for the preservation of culture, heritage, and identity as much as it did against the claws of colonization, slavery, or any other threats. As long as humanity wields the indomitable spirit to rise above any ordeal that crosses its path, the drums of defiance will reverberate throughout the world and resonate with every earthling.",2025-04-04T16:04:56Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""guscl406"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""bh1ox404"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_31ca5ff1ab8a4228b816b2d2b1c119b3~mv2.jpg""},""width"":1267,""height"":1558}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""xarps407"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""4zzzl286"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The djembe, a traditional West African drum, is a perdurable musical instrument known for its powerful and sophisticated sound.

Recognized...",4,[],FALSE,shah-abdul-karim-melody-of-love-spirituality-and-unity,,"Born in Sunamganj, Bangladesh, on the shores of the Kalni River, Shah Abdul Karim is a legendary figure in Bengali Baul music. Recognized as the Baul Shomrat (Baul King,) Karim's songs echoed from villages of Bangladesh to international stages, putting together an unforgettable image of the simplicity and spirituality of rural Bangla. He wrote more than 1,600 songs during his lifetime, and his profound lyrics won over millions of hearts. Even though many of his compositions have been lost just because they were not documented, his philosophy lives on in the pieces that still inspire and connect people worldwide. On February 5, 1916, in the Sunamganj district's Ujan Dhol village, Shah Abdul Karim was born into a poor family. Being the only son out of six siblings, like most people living in poverty in the villages of Bangladesh he had to adjust to the harsh realities of life at an early age. While he had to work as a herdsman for just Tk 2 to support his family, his early years were filled with hardship. Despite his hardships, music became Karim's haven during long days of handling cattle. Karim first heard the Baul music from his grandfather, Nasibullah who was a wandering mystic. As a result of this early exposure, Karim found his lifelong passion, Music. Which can be heard in his songs, “I don't want anything but music. I sing songs. To convince my heart. But my heart is in the land of the crazies(for music).” The only form of formal education Karim had was during British rule when a night school was established in his village. Unfortunately, after only eight days, the school was shut down due to rumors of World War II conscription. Without access to a traditional school, Karim got his education from nature, its people, and his own experiences. Once in an interview, he expressed, “I am not being boastful. I became more knowledgeable than school-going people with the blessings of peers and murshid (holy man and tutor) and the experiences gifted by the creator. And because of this gift, you love me so much and came to me. There are many more Karims like me who are wandering around. But you came to me.” Despite Karim's unwavering devotion to music, the extremists of the country opposed him. He encountered strong opposition from the villagers too, who called him a ""Kafir"" for not up music. And took his lyrics as a threat to their beliefs. This is to some extent true as he did not believe in any institutionalized religion. To the threats he responded,  “I won’t promise something I won’t do later. I won’t lie in front of everyone.” Because of his honesty, he lost his house and was forced into exile. Karim left his village and wandered around town before taking sanctuary in Gandha, a village with a strong musical heritage. Despite the social rejection, Karim's exile was a pivotal moment that strengthened his ties to the Baul philosophy. To get him out of his Boula life his parents forced him to marry Kachamala when he was 35. The marriage lasted only for a short period as his love of music took priority over his household duties. Karim demonstrated his dedication to his true love by choosing his art over his family. Aftabunnesa, his second wife, affectionately known as Sorola, became his dearest companion and pillar of support. This is what Karim had to say about Sorola, “She was named Boishakhi. I found her simple-natured and started calling her Shorola(someone who is simple).”  Because of Sorola's caring support, Karim was able to fully focus on his music despite their financial difficulties. She often told him, “If I tie you down with my saree, how will you ever explore the world? And if you don’t go out and meet people, how will you understand life or compose your songs?” He wrote many many songs expressing his love for her. Karim's life was left empty after Sorola passed away in 1987. Karim lived with the pain of her loss for the rest of his life, filled with guilt over not being there for her in her last moments. Even at her funeral, the local imam refused to perform her burial rituals, further demonstrating the social rejection he experienced. Karim went on and performed her funeral prayers himself. Sorola was buried in a room opposite to where he stayed in their home reflecting his deep love and attachment to her. Themes of love, spirituality, and social justice were all woven together in Shah Abdul Karim's music. His Baul philosophy, defended simplicity and humanity while criticizing materialism and religious dogmas. The essence of rural life and the hardships faced by people were encapsulated in his lyrics. Karim’s songs, such as “Gari Cholena Cholena”, “Ami Koolhara Kolonkini”, “Kemone Bulibo Tara”, “Shokhi Tora Prem Koriona”, ""Age ki shundor din kataitam"" and ""Maya lagaise,"" remain popular with listeners even people who are not into Baul music. Karim’s profound insights into life and spirituality found universal appeal. His ability to express complex emotions in simple yet powerful lyrics solidified his place as a storyteller and philosopher. He received numerous awards filling his rooms. He was also honored with Ekushey Padak in 2001. Upon receiving his honor he spoke, “I received my honor a long time ago. When I was young. At a farmer’s union, Moulana Bhashani patted me and told me that I am a people’s artist.” Karim often came into conflict with fundamentalists because of his commitment to humanity over religious doctrine. His songs, which welcomed spirituality and love, occasionally drew criticism for breaking with conventions. On September 12, 2009, at the age of 93, Karim passed away. His body was laid in state at the Shaheed Minar, where thousands gathered to pay respect. In his honor, a fleet of boats sailed him to Dhul Gram, his village, where he was buried next to Sorola. His songs were collected in six books: Aftab Sangeet, Gano Sangeet, Kalnir Dhew, Dholmela, Bhatir Chithi, and Kalnir Kooley. The Bangla Academy translated 10 of his songs into English, to expand his legacy to a global audience.  Shah Abdul Karim's songs are still performed by traditional Bauls across Bangladesh and West Bengal, maintaining authenticity. Artists from genres other than Bauls such as Habib Wahid, Arifin Rumey, Kaya, and Helal have transformed his songs for modern listeners. ensuring that his legacy is embraced by both the younger and older generations.  Reminding us of the importance of love, spirituality, and humanity in a world consumed by materialism and division.",2025-01-10T17:00:07Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""\n"",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Born in Sunamganj, Bangladesh, on the shores of the Kalni River, Shah Abdul Karim is a legendary figure in Bengali Baul music.

He is revered as the father of Afrobeat and throughout his life, he has been a musical and cultural revolutionary figure. Fela's music and his voice of resistance have surpassed the boundaries of his homeland to become a global symbol. A fleeting glance over his life and work is enough to draw the conclusion that he had an unfathomable power to wield music as a weapon against dilapidated social structure and unjust political arbitrariness. This article sheds light on a mere slice of Fela Kuti's life who has changed the course of world music and political reformation. Born on October 15, 1938, in Abeokuta, Nigeria, as Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti but this Pan-Africanist is known to the masses as Fela Anikulapo Kuti or Fela Kuti. He hails from an upper-middle-class Nigerian family with his mother Chief Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, and father Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti. While growing up, having an anti-colonial feminist mother along with a minister and principal father, both of whom played active roles in the anti-colonial movement in Nigeria, Fela was bound to develop an innate sense of justice and freedom. Such an environment of intellectual and political exposure imparted to him the ability to develop his own worldview. In 1958, Fela moved to London to study medicine, which was what his parents wished for him. Despite the initial acceptance of his parents' wish, he couldn't refuse his call to music. Eventually, leaving medicine behind, started his pursuit of music. Fela admitted himself to the Trinity College of Music, and there he formed his first band, Koola Lobitos. Their music blended jazz with highlife, a popular West African music genre. This was his first step into the contemporary music scene and also the beginning of his extensive experimentation in search of his own sound staying true to his African roots. Encouraged by his father, Fela Kuti learned to play multiple instruments like saxophone, piano, trumpet, and occasionally drums. He grew up with his father's belief, ""Education is not complete without the knowledge of music,"" and this mindset was always with him in his pursuit of generic sound. Yet, his parents were not in the same boat as him when it came to his choice of music. His mother wanted him to play music that everyone could understand, not jazz. And here, we get a glimpse of who Fela truly is as a musician, and as an individual. He could have achieved mainstream success by making mainstream music. But he almost didn't care, commercial success was not what he sought. He sought Groove. The Intricate structure of his songs and the usual length of each track were his declaration of artistic freedom. By virtue of this stubbornness, at the peak of his career, he was known as one of Africa's most ""challenging and charismatic music performers"". The crucial breakthrough in his career occurred in the late 1960s. Fela Kuti successfully combined traditional African music with Jazz, funk, and highlife and developed Afrobeat. As a genre, Afrobeat is characterized by its complex polyrhythms, extended instrumental jams, and chanted vocals. In the later years, many artists and bands adopted the ideas of Afrobeat and carried on the legacy left by Fela. Parallel to his relentless musical endeavor another central motif of his life was being nurtured in him as well. Before his Afrobeat era, when he returned to Nigeria, Fela returned with a renewed sense of purpose. In 1969, Fela spent ten months in Los Angeles with his band. There he came across the Black Power movement. The Black Power movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s and this left a profound impact on Fela when he witnessed the Civil rights struggle in the US. This is where he encountered James Brown, an American singer, dancer, and an important American influence on Kuti's musical style. Upon returning to Nigeria, his music became a powerful tool for his political activism. He reformed the band and changed its name. The tone in his music shifted and the lyrics spoke of socio-political issues of both Nigeria and Africa. His voice of resistance reverberated beyond Africa. His stern position against the corruption of Nigerian government officials drew both amicable and inimical attention to him. Corruption, oppression, colonialism, and many other relevant issues were at the core of his music. Songs like 'Zombie,' 'Shakara,' and 'Sorrow, Tears, and Blood' are still relevant in 21st-century Africa. In the '70s, Fela formed the Kalakuta Republic. It served as his recording studio and a place for his family. This accommodated many people who were associated with the band in one way or the other. Kalakuta was not just a residence; it was a cultural and political hub free of any political restraints. In this place, Fela could express his ideas freely and challenge the autocracy.  Fela took a bold step and declared the Kalakuta Republic as an independent state. Members of this community faced frequent raids, as the government wasn't pleased with Fela's activism and the growing popularity of his music. Being outspoken and defiant to the Nigerian authorities had already made him a target. This resulted in clashes between Fela and the governing regime of Nigeria. The situation got out of hand when 1000 soldiers raided his place, beat Fela and they even threw Fela's mother out of the window. They burned the place down along with his instruments and recordings. These barbaric actions were taken in response to Fela's album Zombie (1977) where he had criticized Nigerian military methods. Fela Kuti was undeterred through all these acts of violence against him. He always had his weapons - his voice, his music. His albums were grabbing mass attention and enraging the government in the process. Each of his albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, was a mockery of contemporary political issues in Fela's own characteristic blend of wit, anger, and musical brilliance. Fela Kuti's life tells a story of the inherent power of music and how it can bring in social change. His incessant activism and groundbreaking musical innovations have left a timeless mark on the world. Fela realized the bigger picture of life, music, and politics. His Afrobeat was a movement; it was a voice for the voiceless and oppressed people of Africa.

The more a community adheres...",4,[],FALSE,echoes-of-heritage-the-intersection-of-black-music-and-black-identity,,"As an expression of identity, among all other art forms, music is ubiquitously found in nearly all cultures. The more a community adheres to its origin and heritage, the more likely it is to cherish a profound musical tradition of its own. This holds for true Black communities across the globe.  For African Americans, music has been a mode of self-expression from the very beginning. Their music is a means for  preserving  history and celebrating their past, present and future. While jazz and hip-hop are, more often than not, what one might recall when it comes to Black music, but  the story of Black musical identity is far more significant. This article is all about the exploration of  the inseverable connection between Black music and identity. The Ancestral Root of Music In the first one and a half centuries of slavery, West Central Africa traded nine out of ten African people as slaves. West Central Africa sent more slaves to the Americas than any other region. These enslaved people who were destined to go through a harsh ordeal, found their solace in music-one of the few things they were left with after they lost their freedom. It was a part of  the communal activity apart from being a spiritual practice. To honor ancestors or to appease deities, music was integral for them. Drums, stringed instruments, and vocal harmonies were indispensable to rituals and ceremonies. Enslaved Africans either carried African instruments with them or reconstructed them in the New World. Although slaves were often forbidden from owning a drum as they could use drums to communicate secretly and coordinate escape attempts. Nevertheless, under slavery, African American music retained many African elements. Historian and author W.E.B. Du Bois once wrote that the folk-songs were the rhythmic cry of the slave which they really were. How Past Shapes the Future As the elements of African traditions seeped into the existing American music, it brought in a new dimension to not only compositional style but also to the instruments. Take the banjo for instance,  its roots can be traced to West African instruments. It was created by enslaved Africans and their descendants in the Caribbean and colonial North America which is closely related to the akonting, a three-stringed instrument. The blues was the first music that African Americans created that was entirely their own, free from the direct influence of European musical forms. The quintessential scale for many American genres, the blues scale originates from Africa. It is not found in the classical Western tradition or other musical traditions around the world. Similarly, the polyrhythms and call-and-response patterns characteristic of African music found their way into many modern genres as well. The Reflection of Identity Music may be the most important artistic form for invoking memories and longings that constitute personal and collective identity. American singer and civil rights activist Nina Simone famously remarked, ""An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times."" For Black artists, this translates to using music to find comfort in their identity or confront injustice. Black music represents the struggles of the past, and also the ongoing fight for equality. With the changing times, it continued to reflect the shifts in social, political, and cultural paradigm. Doubting one's true self runs deep in the Black community. The reason becomes obvious upon a brief contemplation: Black people were taught for centuries that everything about them is ""wrong."" The idea that whiteness is “right and good” and blackness is considered “wrong and evil” has pushed Black people into a bottomless pit of self-hatred, specifically the younger ones. During past decades, Black music has embraced new styles and technologies, staying true to its roots of course, to evolve. Genres like funk, soul, and electronic music have redefined the boundaries of Black musical expression, so much so that funk is considered ""the DNA of Black music."" Beyond the Boundary Many Black communities reside outside the United States, and in each of those, music was crucial in upholding their identity through blending traditional African rhythms with local influences. The genres that emerged from those regions show uncannily conspicuous reflection of their history, struggles, and resilience.  The reggae music of Jamaican artists like Bob Marley and Burning Spear promote the glory of African pride and unity, while in Trinidad and Tobago, calypso artists such as Mighty Sparrow and Calypso Rose were up to something unique. They incorporated witty and satirical lyrics to their music, addressing issues and celebrating Afro-Caribbean identity. The style of music that played a key role in popularizing African music to the global audience was Afrobeat. Nigerian Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti brought forth a mix of traditional Yoruba sounds with funk, and his music was nothing short of a frontal attack on colonialism and corruption. South African legends like Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela crafted their own weapon against apartheid by blending mbaqanga and jazz to realize their dream of Pan-African unity. Beyond the World of Music Activist and scholar Angela Davis sheds light on  the political dimensions of Black music in her book ""Blues Legacies and Black Feminism.""  In her opinion women like Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were instrumental to challenge societal norms regarding rights and security of Black women and advocate for a space where Black women could openly express their desires and frustrations. The steel-like nerve and unweaving spirit of Black artists fascinated  poet Langston Hughes for whom Black music was a source of pride and inspiration. This alone solidifies  the power and authenticity of Black identity, and it was possible through coming to terms with deep-seated connection with their own sound. Final Words The tapestry of life is  interwoven with music. It is the one thing that has the power to touch everyone's spirit and transcend all barriers. Any attempt to oppress and discriminate against a group of  people would be rendered futile by their music and the unshakable sense of the collective and individual identity.  Music has been a beacon of freedom, strength, creativity, and identity for African Americans. Be that enslaved Africans or the contemporary Black artists, the innate drive to break out from the shackles of prejudice and conquer the world is what bestows power to their music. For African Americans, music has always been a source of pride and  testament to the enduring power of Black identity.",2025-02-07T17:08:10Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""As an expression of identity, among all other art forms, music is ubiquitously found in nearly all cultures.

Our protagonist of this article, Busi Mhlongo, follows the suit. From the rural village of Ndwedwe, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Mhlongo was a musical powerhouse whose work and charisma surpassed and overshadowed the fame and artistry of her contemporaries. Overthrowing the very notion of genres, cultures, and borders, her music is an eclectic and characteristic blend of traditional and Western styles of making music. A tangible and meaningful spirituality and sharp social consciousness that listeners sense in her music could not have been the work of just a singer. It is obvious that she was a storyteller, a healer, and a voice for the marginalized. Busisiwe Victoria Mhlongo affectionately and respectfully known as ‘Mam’Busi,’ began her journey into music in early childhood, busking in her Zulu heritage's cultural and spiritual traditions. Growing up in a rural village, she had the chance of being exposed to the rich oral traditions of her people which included not only music but also other forms of art like storytelling, traditional dances, and spiritual rituals. Her talent was evident from a very young age, and she began singing in church choirs and concert groups while still at school. Like many black South Africans during the apartheid era, however, Mhlongo faced systemic oppression and limited opportunities. In the 1970s, Mhlongo moved to Johannesburg to pursue her musical career. It was the cultural hub of South Africa, more like a breeding ground for music and musicians. Mhlongo's experimentation began in this city. She had drawn from a wide palette of musical genres from various South African musical styles, especially traditional Zulu, and fused with contemporary elements from funk, rock, gospel, rap, opera, reggae, and West African music. Mhlongo rose to prominence during a period of intense political and social turmoil in South Africa when the movements against apartheid were gaining momentum, and day by day music was taking a crucial role in inspiring the masses. Her powerful lyrics and melodies resonated with the struggle against apartheid in no time. For instance, her breakthrough album, ""Urban Zulu"" (1998), was a landmark in her career and South African music. This album metamorphosed, deepened, and finally turned into a representation of the Zulu Nation’s truest form of expression. Notice the album’s title itself, it can be interpreted as a bold assertion of African identity in a society that was systematically devalued by colonialism and apartheid. As you have guessed already, Zulu music has the greatest influence on Mhlongo and her music. So, we should take a look at what Zulu music is. It is obvious from the name that Zulu music is an expression of the cultural identity and spirituality of the Zulu people of South Africa. What is interesting is that It works as a bridge between the physical and spiritual worlds, which is an important and central philosophy behind their sound. Among many styles, Maskanda is a style of Zulu folk music that originated in South Africa. The songs are about real-life experiences and it's often called the ""Zulu Blues."" This style is often unfairly accredited to Zulu male musicians, and women’s contributions to Maskanda were losing their footing as the style evolved. Mhlongo picked up Maskanda where her predecessors left it and brought justice for them by proving the power of this genre through her success. One of the defining features of Busi Mhlongo’s music has to be the depth of spirituality. She often noted her music as a form of healing, both for herself and for her listeners. She was an initiated sangoma and it heavily influenced her music. A sangoma is a practitioner of Ngoma, a philosophy based on a belief in ancestral spirits and the practice of traditional African medicine. The spiritual dimensionality of her compositions is palpable from her 2004 work ""Indiza."" The central theme revolves around family, tradition, and reconciliation in a rural setup of South Africa. The title ""Indiza"" means ""airplane"" in Zulu, symbolizing the journey between urban and rural life. In Johannesburg, she recorded a cover of an international hit track ""My Boy Lollipop"" for the Gallo label which was a pan-African success. Her incredible vocal range allowed her to go from a soft note to a booming roar. As her music gained recognition and fame, it was also morphing into a symbol of the struggle for justice in South Africa. Her fearless activism against apartheid through her music was noticed soon by the government. As a consequence, Mhlongo was exiled from her country. Therefore, she had to move to multiple countries such as the Netherlands, North America, and the UK. Mhlongo’s music was her own space where she deconstructed the social stigmas and taboos. Her songs often feature the struggles of women, the poor, and those affected by HIV/AIDS, a crisis that has had a devastating impact on South Africa. In a society where such issues were often ignored, her music provided a haven where these sensitive issues were flashed out without any hesitation or pretense. Mhlongo’s creations and her staunch commitment to her principles, culture, and people are essentially the catalysts that have accelerated and solidified her position in the pantheon of prominent figures in South African music as well as beyond the border of the country itself. Throughout her life, maybe unknowingly but surely she has established a platform for artists who are courageous enough to manifest their inner voice and their rebellious self. She has been a role model for African female musicians for generations after generations. In a world where commercial success over artistic integrity is often prioritized, Busi Mhlongo’s career signifies the cognitive and spiritual awakening of a true artist. She was not just a musician; she was a healer, a revolutionary without a shred of doubt.  For her excellent contribution to music and putting South Africa on the international music map, Mhlongo has been recognized and lauded by critics and fans alike, and rightfully so. As a generational talent, Mhlongo and the music she had left behind is now an undeterrable tsunami that will continue to sweep away all that is rotten in our brain or at the core of our modern society.",2025-03-14T15:59:08Z,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""pzg2b1013"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""f4cud1011"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""d717d4_76c8a0d1e8394844a1b82ca3fde7ba8e~mv2.png""},""width"":201,""height"":251}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""mn5441014"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""qzrup913"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Most of the global icons who hailed from the continent of Africa had humble beginnings before becoming some of the most revered musicians in the world of music.

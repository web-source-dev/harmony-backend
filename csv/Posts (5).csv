And behind some of its most seismic shifts was a drummer whose thunderous yet intricate playing expanded what rhythm could mean in jazz: Elvin Jones . Born in Pontiac , Michigan , in 1927 , Jones was the youngest of ten children in a musically gifted family. His brothers Thad , a trumpeter and composer, and Hank , a pianist of crystalline elegance, would also become towering figures. Elvin , however, carved his legacy with sticks and cymbals, crafting a style that seemed to split time wide open. He first gained notice in the late 1950*s, working with *Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins , and Bud Powell . But it was his tenure with John Coltrane’s quartet in the *1960*s that made him immortal. Together with pianist McCoy Tyner  and bassist Jimmy Garrison , Jones formed a rhythm section that was at once volcanic and delicate, able to sustain Coltrane’s epic flights with unyielding intensity. On albums like A Love Supreme and  Crescent, Jones ’s drumming surged like ocean waves—rolling triplets, crashing cymbals, and a storm-like energy that redefined jazz rhythm as something more expansive than mere timekeeping. “Playing with Elvin was like being on a ship in the middle of a hurricane,” Tyner once said.  “You had to trust the ride.” What separated Jones from his contemporaries was his polyrhythmic approach, layering beats upon beats, suggesting multiple tempos simultaneously. His playing could feel chaotic, yet it was deeply grounded, drawing on the African roots  of jazz while pushing it toward the avant-garde . Critics often likened his sound to elemental forces—earthquakes, rivers, tempests—yet musicians spoke of the freedom he provided, an openness within which improvisation could stretch without limits. After Coltrane ’s death in 1967, Jones embarked on his own bandleading career. His group, the  Elvin Jones Jazz Machine , nurtured generations of musicians, offering younger players a proving ground much as Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers  had.  Jones ’s drum kit became both anchor and engine, a reminder that rhythm could be as expressive as melody or harmony. Off the bandstand, Jones was known for his warmth and humor. His laughter, much like his playing, came in torrents. Yet on stage he was a figure of intensity—his arms blurring, sweat flying, cymbals ringing like church bells. To hear him was to experience not just drumming but a kind of musical weather system. Elvin Jones  died in 2004 at the age of 76 , but his presence still reverberates. Every drummer who has come since—whether in jazz, rock, or beyond—has felt his influence, often without even realizing it. In the pantheon of jazz rhythm, he is less a player than a force, the heartbeat of modern improvisation. “Without Elvin,” said drummer Jack DeJohnette , “we’d all still be playing on the ground. He lifted the drums into the air.”",0,"en",2025-08-20T16:00:14Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""08g6o398"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_ea86b48e986a4d2aa8f29511ce7db163~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/UncBE-tqm1Y"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""lsra6401"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""xtbzs414"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""elgqt416"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""By the "",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""mid-20th century"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":"", jazz was a music in motion, reshaping itself nightly in smoky clubs and on restless recordings.

For nearly three decades, his work has navigated that liminal space, marrying a meticulous academic rigor with an ear for the lived pulse of culture. Zenón , 48 , is widely recognized as one of jazz’s most inventive thinkers, a MacArthur “genius” Fellow  who has released a series of conceptually ambitious albums on themes ranging from Puerto Rican  poetry to the plena  and jíbaro  traditions. His 2014  recording Identities Are Changeable , which explores the complexities of Puerto Rican  identity in New York , remains a benchmark of how jazz can interrogate questions of history, migration, and belonging without forfeiting swing or spontaneity. Raised in San Juan , Zenón  left Puerto Rico  in the mid-1990s  to study at Berklee College of Music , arriving in Boston  with little money but an enormous sense of mission. He would go on to co-found the groundbreaking SFJAZZ Collective , standing out for the balance he struck between blazing improvisation and architectural clarity. His tone piercing yet elegant calls to mind Jackie McLean , though his phrasing is wholly his own, often darting with rhythmic intricacy or hovering patiently over the barline. In conversation, Zenón  speaks with the same precision that defines his music. He is both historian and craftsman, a musician as likely to reference Fernando Ortiz  as Charlie Parker . Yet, despite his intellectual depth, he has never lost sight of the human element. “* The music is a reflection of the people *,” he has said in countless interviews, “* and I want it to feel like home *.” For many younger musicians, Zenón  is a model of what it means to root avant-garde exploration in cultural memory. His recent projects whether his quartet’s probing albums or his commissions for chamber ensembles continue to push toward new possibilities without severing ties to the community that shaped him. In a jazz landscape that often leans toward the commercial or the abstract, Zenón  remains singular: a player whose every solo is a negotiation between place and possibility, and whose compositions insist that tradition and progress are not opposing forces, but intertwined currents.",0,"en",2025-09-03T16:00:28Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""jleb4408"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_b4909c299c9e47dabdd2a7f0d775d56e~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/IVdyfXa3sdE"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""b9wpl377"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""7opi9423"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""dz2fj431"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Miguel Zenón"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":"", the "",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Puerto Rican-born"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":"" alto saxophonist and composer, has built a career on reconciling what others might view as incompatible: the folkloric traditions of his homeland and the harmonic sophistication of contemporary jazz.

For more than five decades, Jarrett has straddled genres with startling fluidity, commanding respect in jazz, classical, and the undefinable terrain between them. Jarrett first drew widespread notice in the late 1960*s as a sideman with *Art Blakey  and later Miles Davis , though even then he seemed unwilling to be anyone’s accompanist for long. His lanky frame hunched over the piano, his body contorting, humming audibly along with every note, he made performance into something closer to ritual. It was The Köln Concert in 1975 , however, that turned him from a cult figure into an unlikely star. Recorded under miserable conditions—an out-of-tune piano, a frazzled performer who nearly canceled—the improvised solo recital became the best-selling piano album of all time. Its cascading lyricism and structural daring remain a touchstone for listeners who never otherwise ventured into jazz. Jarrett’s subsequent career often seemed like a rejection of fame as much as an embrace of art. He moved seamlessly between his Standards  Trio with Gary Peacock  and Jack DeJohnette , whose conversational interplay reimagined the American songbook, and sprawling solo concerts where no two evenings were alike. In the 1980*s and *’90*s, he recorded *Bach  and Shostakovich with as much reverence as he gave to Gershwin. But Jarrett was also notoriously mercurial. He was known to berate audiences for coughing, to walk offstage if he felt disrespected, to cancel tours for stretches of convalescence. His relationship with the public seemed governed by an unshakable belief that music was not entertainment but necessity, to be honored with near-spiritual discipline. When a series of strokes in 2018 effectively ended his performing career, Jarrett retreated into near silence. For admirers, the news felt like the closing of an era—not simply the loss of a performer, but of a philosopher at the keyboard, someone who insisted, however obstinately, that improvisation was a window into the deepest reaches of human possibility. Keith Jarrett ’s legacy is not tidy. It resists the categories of jazz, classical, or popular music, just as he himself resisted compromise. But for anyone who has felt the spell of his improvisations, the memory is indelible: one man, alone at the piano, conjuring worlds as fragile and infinite as breath.",0,"en",2025-09-10T16:00:28Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""f3mqf406"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_b81313a5975c4258b206815c7c73361a~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/AP3BJ9apqAo"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""7e6x6409"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""hrl1r450"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""gqr5t452"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Few musicians have balanced genius and volatility as precariously as "",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Keith Jarrett"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":"", the pianist whose career has been equal parts revelation and rupture.

The rolling parade rhythms of New Orleans , the crackling urgency of bebop, and the uncharted explorations of the avant-garde all coalesced into a style as singular as it was deeply rooted. Blackwell , born in New Orleans  in 1929 , remains one of jazz’s most essential yet underappreciated drummers. He was a fixture of Ornette Coleman ’s groundbreaking quartets of the 1960 s, propelling some of the most radical music of the 20th century  with a rhythmic language that never abandoned dance, swing, or joy. His sound could be thunderous, but it was rarely heavy; his touch was light and buoyant, his sense of time elastic yet unshakeable. To hear Blackwell play was to hear the Crescent City  itself refracted through modernism. His snare drum chatter echoed the second-line parade, his cymbal work suggested street brass bands and Caribbean rhythms. But in Ornette Coleman ’s free jazz settings, those roots took flight. On This Is Our Music  (1961) and Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation  (1960), Blackwell helped reimagine what timekeeping meant: not strict meter, but a fluid conversation. He made space, let the music breathe, and filled silences with color rather than clutter. “ Blackwell had this remarkable ability to ground the music in tradition while letting it soar into the future,” said the late critic Stanley Crouch . “He was a modernist, but his modernism came with the warmth of the past.” Despite his association with Coleman, Blackwell ’s artistry extended far beyond free jazz. He was a vital member of the cooperative band Old and New Dreams —alongside D on Cherry, Dewey Redman , and Charlie Haden —where his drumming revealed a profound lyricism. His dialogue with bassist Haden , in particular, remains a masterclass in listening and interplay. Blackwell ’s later years, marked by his tenure at Wesleyan University  in Connecticut , cemented his role as both performer and educator. Students recall his emphasis on the drum’s melodic possibilities—an approach that treated rhythm not as background but as conversation. Even as kidney disease wore on him, he continued to play with astonishing vitality, leaving behind recordings like The Complete Remastered Recordings on Black Saint & Soul Note , which showcase a drummer undiminished in spirit. Blackwell ’s greatness lies not just in technical innovation but in his ability to embody continuity: the bridge between Congo Square  and the avant-garde, between the syncopated strut of New Orleans  and the fearless flights of free jazz. His drumming was history and prophecy at once, a reminder that progress in music need not abandon its roots. Today, Blackwell may not be as celebrated as Elvin Jones  or Tony Williams , but among musicians, his influence is indelible. His rhythms ripple through generations of drummers who see in his work a model of freedom tethered to tradition. Ed Blackwell  died in 1992, but his drums still seem to resound—joyful, restless, deeply human. In every rolling press, every dancing cymbal, one hears both where jazz has been and where it dares to go.",0,"en",2025-08-27T16:00:24Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""xjvpm405"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_6251f2ffd7244658a0402c4896ba4586~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/r9S_iHWLmAY"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""ch0tv408"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""ozwhm435"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""When "",""decorations"":[]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Edward Joseph Blackwell"",""decorations"":[{""type"":""BOLD"",""fontWeightValue"":700}]}},{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":"" sat behind the drum kit, history seemed to gather in his hands.

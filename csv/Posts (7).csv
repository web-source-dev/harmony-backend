Sometimes, music raises a voice of awareness  that becomes louder than a missile strike and powerful enough to bring people together to stand against the oppression. Nonetheless, the musicians who hold this power surely become a nightmare for the tyrants & dictators. Many musicians lose their lives fighting wars against monarchs, and one such name is Victor Jara , who will be remembered as the brightest star in history. Despite neither singing in Engl ish nor having a significant impact on Western music, Victor Lidio Jara Martínez  became a global symbol of resistance due to the manner of his death and the symbolic silence of his music. Early Life, Education, & Devotion to Music On September 28, 1932, Víctor Lidio Jara Martinez  was born. He had five siblings, and his parents were tenant farmers who lived twelve kilometers from Chillán Viejo , close to the hamlet of La Quiriquin a. His father was illiterate and preferred that his children work in the fields rather than attend school. His mother, on the other hand, could read a bit and insisted from the start that they learn the alphabet. A Mapuche mestiza from southern Chile, Jara ’s mother had taught herself to play the guitar and piano. Also, she sang at local occasions like as weddings and funerals, using a repertoire of traditional folk songs. With her help, Victor and three of his siblings became educated. Eventually, he studied to become a priest, but he became disillusioned with the catholic church and decided to leave. He said, “I think it was a very intimate and affective affair. Looking back a little, now and with greater maturity, it was nothing more than loneliness, the disencounter with a world that you have kept solid, home and maternal affection and suddenly it disappears and everything disappears, so you have that affection next to young boys who have a relationship with a Church and well I took refuge there. Then I considered that this refuge led me to other values of encounter with another, deeper affection that perhaps came to balance that lack of interior affection, believing that I found that affection in religion, in dedicating myself to the priesthood.” A fellow choir member at the University of Chile  pushed Víctor Jara  to pursue theater studies. Eventually, he received a scholarship and appeared in plays with social themes, including The Lower Depths  by Maxim Gorky . His passion for Chilean and ^Latin American* folk music grew when he joined the group Cuncumén in 1957 and met notable folk artist Violeta Parra . Influenced by Parra, Pablo Neruda , and Atahualpa Yupanqui , Jara became involved in the Nueva Canción  movement and frequently performed at Santiago’s La Peña de Los Parra . Víctor Jara (1966), Jara ’s debut solo album, contained folk music from Chile and Latin America  and was republished under different titles. His second album, Desde Lonquén Hasta Siempre , was published in 1967. He also worked with Quilapayún on Canciones folklóricas de América in 1968 and completely abandoned theater by 1970 in order to concentrate on his musical career. Victor Jara’s Political Stand to Fight for the People Early in his career, Víctor Jara ’s politically provocative and satirical songs, including the outlawed "" La beata ,”caused controversy among conservatives. He joined the Communist Party  and composed music that addressed injustice and poverty after being influenced by trips to Cuba and the Soviet Union . He was the target of right-wing violence after he sang the protest song "" Preguntas por Puerto Montt "" in 1969 , which denounced a government massacre of squatters. Together with his wife,  Joan, Jara  organized cultural events for the new socialist government and wrote the campaign anthem, "" Venceremos ,” for Salvador Allende ’s 1970 campaign. He performed all over the world, worked with Pablo Neruda , and became quite famous. His voice even gave rise to myths in Soviet media. While in Chile’s Technical University  on September 11, 1973, during the U.S.-backed coup that overthrew Allende and installed Augusto Pinochet , Jara spent the night singing to raise spirits with other students.  Following the coup, Chileans thought to be affiliated with leftist organizations, such as Allende’s Popular Unity  party, were apprehended by Pinochet’s troops. Along with thousands of other people, Jara was captured and imprisoned inside Estadio Chile on the morning of September 12, 1973. Tragic Death Although there are a lot of contradictory reports on Jara's final days, the 2019 Netflix documentary Massacre at the Stadium  puts together a compelling story. Jara was quickly identified as a well-known artist and Allende fan as he entered the stadium. Jara was forced to crawl for a lit cigarette that an army officer had thrown on the ground before being stamped on the wrists. After being removed from the other prisoners, Jara was subjected to torture and beatings in the stadium's interior.  He once performed Allende’s 1970 election anthem, "" Venceremos (We Will Win) ”, with his lips split in defiance. According to a fellow prisoner, Jara requested a pen and notebook on the morning of the 16th and scrawled the lyrics to "" Estadio Chile ,"" which were subsequently smuggled out of the stadium: ""How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror. / Horror which I am living, horror which I am dying."" He was shot to death two hours later, and his body was discarded in the street after being covered with 40 machine gun rounds. Following his murder, Jara’s body was put on display for other inmates to view at Chile Stadium's entrance. Forty-two years later, in July 2015, former Chilean military officers were accused of his murder. A Chilean court upheld a conviction in August 2023, sending seven former soldiers, who ranged in age from 73 to 85 at the time of their sentencing, to prison terms ranging from 8 to 25 years. Final Words “We are 5,000, here in this little corner of the city.  How many are we in all the cities of the world?  All of us, our eyes fixed on death.  How terrifying is the face of Fascism  For them, blood is a medal, Carnage is a heroic gesture. Song, I cannot sing you well When I must sing out of fear.  When I am dying of fright.  When I find myself in these endless moments.  Where silence and cries are the echoes of my song.” This is his final poem, which was extracted from the stadium just before he was shot to death. Victor Jara  may have had the horrible death that no one expected, but millions of Chileans still appreciate Víctor Jara ’s music nearly 40 years after his passing, and his legacy endures. Following his death, he rose to fame in Chile and is still mentioned in well-known songs both locally and internationally. The stadium where he died, Chile Stadium, is now known as "" Estadio Víctor Jara. ”",0,"en",2025-08-22T16:00:18Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""mtbun405"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_e6b45ca2c074449e99819b0cddee1a59~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/Op9yfQWVJ2A"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""uu0xy408"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""9fcgh421"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""z0p77423"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""For many decades, music has been a powerful tool against the unjust to fight for the rights of the people who are neglected and suffer.

However grim that may sound, that is just how it is now.  The guns and war-machines do go quiet eventually, and leave us with a deafening silence which feels too heavy.  The end of conflicts marks the birth of something else—the invisible wounds, trauma, and mistrust. Each clash gives new scars to the wall of national and international relationships. Each conflict leaves a lot to rebuild, from roads to governments. But what deserves the utmost importance is healing human connections. In healing such invisible and deep spiritual wounds, music might be able to prove its worth and how it is way more than a means for entertainment. The language of music does not solely rely on words or syntax. Even an obscure style of music has the power to move someone’s spirit.  A song does not ask for agreement but empathy, and that is where the uniqueness of music lies. In this article, we are going to explore how music has supported and helped rebuild the post-conflict period in Rwanda, Northern Ireland , and the Balkans . And accentuate the role of music as a natural healer of humanity. Music as a Bridge of Empathy Why does music work so well? It works because it can connect people emotionally. While singing, drumming, or playing together, the rhythms and breathing of the people involved get synchronized, i.e., people feel connected emotionally. This gives rise to a ripple of harmony in the body and mind, which in turn reinforces a sense of belonging and brotherhood. The landscape that music can create is fundamentally different from political debates or any other method of “discourse.” Music allows us to express difficult emotions without being confrontational. It softens narratives remarkably and opens up doors to empathy.  Empathy is the answer we are looking for. Being able to empathize with others is much easier through music. In a period following a conflict, music becomes one of the effective tools to fight the battle of reconciliation. Rwanda: Songs After the Silence of Genocide In 1994, Rwanda  experienced one of the most brutal genocides of the 20th century . The genocide was rooted in long-standing ethnic tensions. Around 800,000 people were killed in just 100 days, and most of them were Tutsis; hence it also came to be known as “ Tutsi Genocide .”  Grassroots groups had to find ways to move forward, one of which was through music. Many workshops were held on songwriting workshops where people shared their experiences and lyrics became a language of pain, forgiveness, and hope.. These sessions were nowhere near polished performances, but they were real, grounded, and unfiltered. It was more about creating a safe space.  Ingoma Nshya , a women’s drumming collective founded by Odile Katese , has to be mentioned. It is Rwanda ’s first-ever women’s drumming group, which actively involves women’s participation in the development of Rwanda through cultural preservation. Drumming was traditionally reserved for men and forbidden for women. By uniting women, the group broke the cultural norms of pre-genocide Rwanda . Northern Ireland: Singing Beyond the Walls Northern Ireland ’a  conflict, “T he Troubles ,” lasted for three decades from the late 1960*s to *1998 . When the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  started demanding for unbiased treatment of the Catholic-nationalist minority by the Protestant-unionist government, the conflict broke out. "" Peace walls "" were built in some areas to keep the two communities apart. Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists lived in separate neighborhoods. Even after the Good Friday Agreement  in 1998 , which ended the conflict, social divides still live on. Music programs became bridges across these barriers. Community choirs and cross-community rock bands brought young people together who might otherwise never meet. Here we should also mention “ The Ulster Orchestra ,” which played a big role in undermining the conflict. They hosted concerts in both Catholic and Protestant areas; this was their way of preaching inclusivity in public culture. The Balkans: Orchestras Across Divides The wars in the Balkans during the 1990*s were another series of conflicts that left behind ethnic hostility. It was sparked by the growing ethnic nationalism following the death of *Josip Broz Tito , a Yugoslav communist revolutionary and politician, in 1980 . Another orchestra became a symbol of hope and resistance in such dire situations: “ The Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra .” Despite losing seven of their members during the Siege of Sarajevo , along with twelve wounded musicians, damaged musical scores and instruments, the orchestra continued its work and performed 60 concerts, 20 of them abroad. Also, after the war, the orchestra included members from different ethnicities, which shows that art can be the glue that unifies. Music was for both survival and protest. It gave war-ridden communities moments of peace and it was also a reminder for them that cooperation might just still be possible.  The Limits of Music While music is the potion that holds the power of healing a society, it is not a panacea. It can work miracles, not the impossibles. A proper reconciliation needs many things to work together in synergy, such as fair laws, accountability for crimes, and equal opportunities. Can a song provide any of those? Music also has risks associated with it. The reinforcement of insidious nationalism or exclusion can also be achieved through music, which can be seen or heard, in war songs glorifying violence.  For this reason, we must see music as a complement, not a substitute, for political and social transformation or reformation. Music is one of the fuels that has the power to motivate and push us to social justice and a transparent socio-political structure. In that way, we might find the peace we all dream of. Epilogue: Singing Peace After the war, rebuilding communities as well as rebuilding cities, music plays a unique and indispensable role. It arms us with one of the most primal and fundamental qualities of being human—empathy. However, we should stay alert so that we do not romanticize this. Songs alone cannot heal or actively repair something that was broken and shattered by our greed, intolerance, and rage.  What it can do instead is create safe spaces for everyone, regardless of their race or ethnicity. And it can also teach us to empathize with others and share our ephemeral humanity. Paired with justice, or truth, or structural reform, music can become more than sound—it becomes a bridge toward reconciliation.",0,"en",2025-09-12T16:01:23Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""oabqd408"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_16ed17f294e24aba9174269e00708391~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/oeeeikSURvU"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""vp49r411"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""b3m4f440"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""5pfcx442"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Conflicts are now becoming an inseparable factor that drives the dynamics among countries in our modern way of life.

Yet behind the curtain, many artists wrestle with demons that fame does little to soothe. Anxiety, depression , and burnout haunt musicians at alarming rates, often hidden beneath polished performances and carefully curated public images. For many, music is just like any other career, but there are musicians for whom music is a lifeline. For them, music is a way to confront their deepest struggles, seek resolution, and, in turn, offer solace to millions of listeners navigating their own storms. The Silent Epidemic Research consistently portrays a shocking picture. A UK Musicians’ Census  surveyed nearly 6,000 professionals and found that three in ten reported having poor mental well-being. For students just entering the field, the figure becomes more concerning, as the percentage climbed to over 40 . Another international study, which was conducted in 13 countries , revealed that more than half of musicians experience significant anxiety. Moreover, one in three lives with depression. Studies point to the fact that musicians are up to three times more likely to suffer depression than the general population, and that is not all, suicide rates among musicians are disproportionately high. The reasons are more complex than we can imagine. Making one’s career in music demands long, irregular hours, never-ending financial instability, relentless travel, and an extreme lack of privacy.  The very passion that drives an artist is ironically a double-edged sword , which pushes them into emotional exhaustion and collapse. Yet there is something paradoxical in the music itself, and that is “the very thing that contributes to stress often becomes the most powerful tool for healing.” Pain Transformed into Melody: If we look behind throughout history, artists have used their anguish as fuel for their art. They transformed the invisible wounds into sonic masterpieces. In modern music, few embody this more than Kid Cudi , known as the “ lonely stoner ” of hip-hop. His brutal openness about depression and suicidal thoughts has resonated with many of his fans.  His songs, such as “ Soundtrack 2 My Life ” and “ Pursuit of Happiness ,” the first song is a self-reflective track and the second is melancholic, deal with themes of emptiness, addiction , and the fight for life’s purpose . When he admitted himself to rehab in 2016 , he was supported by his fanbase. The way he was able to express his pain through his music openly has helped validate the experiences of listeners as well. Halsey is another outspoken voice who has candidly talked about living with bipolar disorder, which she was diagnosed with during her teenage years. Following a suicide attempt, she has found something to hold onto. She has described songwriting as her anchor.  The lyrics of her songs reveal the chaos and clarity that come from mental illness. These create blurred lines between personal journal entries and pop anthems. She has performed through miscarriages and depressive episodes , which, in my opinion, underscore how music can be both burden and balm. The Mechanics of Musical Healing But how exactly does music help those grappling with depression and anxiety? Songwriting is fundamentally an act of "" transcribing "" emotions into words, melodies, and rhythms. Writing turns intangible, abstract, and complex emotions into something tangible, which often flashes out a pattern or even a solution for decluttering the mess in one’s mind. For many musicians, this brings order to their inner chaos. Depression often makes thoughts spiral or scatter, but music can give them structure. It is easy to understand how the process can be therapeutic, regardless of whether the result is shared publicly. Apart from writing songs, performance is also another way to release the unbearable and unsorted blob of emotional mess. Being on stage is stressful for sure; however, it can also be transformative and introspective. The energy of a crowd and their love for the performing artist can encourage an artist to channel raw feeling into their craft, and in turn, temporarily lift the weight of depression . Studies show that listening to music can play a crucial role in regulating heart rate and influencing brain activity. Fans often report that certain songs felt like they “saved” them—offering strength during suicidal thoughts, heartbreak, or loneliness. This mutual “support” of an artist and their audience underscores how powerful music truly is. Industry Structures and the Need for Change While it is easier to convince anyone that music can be healing, what is controversial is that the industry itself, or the very system that makes it work, is an insidious killer of sound mental health. Take touring schedules as an example. The constant demand for being on the road often results in a lack of well-regulated eating habits and leads to other severe issues, such as sleep deprivation. When it comes to emerging or independent artists, the ephemeral idea of financial stability creates chronic stress. And the incessant scrutiny from fans and social media amplifies their insecurities to alarming degrees. And in many genres, these issues can lead to substance abuse. The way substance abuse is often normalized as a part of the culture and lifestyle of musicianship undoubtedly endangers mental well-being. Without systemic and deliberate changes —fairer pay structures, accessible mental health services, and more humane touring practices—this ceaseless cycle will continue. Charities such as Music Minds Matter  in the UK are beginning to fill the gap, offering free mental health support for musicians. Songs—The Saviour of Lives Without a doubt, a remarkable aspect of the interplay between music and mental health is the power to save lives. I am not talking metaphorically. Fans of Kid Cudi, Halsey , and many other artists often receive letters or messages that express gratitude for making the sender realize how precious their lives are.  These are not exaggerations. Songs can pull listeners back from the brink of breaking down and do the unthinkable. It can be a reminder that others have been pushed to the edge by the ugly reality of what is around us, but they did survive. It is a powerful message. Epilogue: Creativity as Resistance The battle between staying creative and at the same time struggling with depression is one of the most powerful stories in the world of music and its industry. On the one hand, the immeasurable pressure of the industry makes it downright impossible to maintain musicians’ mental health; on the other hand, however, in such dire situations, music itself can transform into a form of resistance. It is all about fighting to stay creative in a world where silence can be deadly. And it is about recognizing that behind every song lies a story, sometimes one of survival itself.",0,"en",2025-09-05T16:00:21Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""dugmi794"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_30b38825e9f6493c9bb9323abc177c79~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/4nUQHRx7ikY"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""amnvl797"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""5v4mq824"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""The music industry, with all its glamour and stardom, has always been dazzling for audiences.

In active conflict zones , it ceases to be only art; it becomes a weapon of resistance, a diary of suffering, and a tool for survival. Soldiers turn to songs to preserve morale, while displaced civilians cling to their cherished melodies that carry their memories of home. Across war-torn landscapes, from the streets of Gaza to the underground basements of Kyiv , music carries both pain and hope; it is both a scar and a trophy, a cry against oppression and a whisper of consolation when silence is unbearable. In this article, we will explore the role of music during war !and in conflict zones . By observing how it has built resilience as well as preserved identity and the untold histories of people amidst the violence of war, we might get a glimpse of the interplay of humanity and music. Through case studies ranging from Palestine*and *Ukraine  to Syria and the Sahrawi refugee camps, we see how songs of survival transcend borders and conflicts, uniting voices of suffering into a universal anthem of endurance. Music as Psychological Survival Those who have seen how gruesome wars , know very well how traumatizing and haunting the scenarios can be. Thus, in war zones, survival is not only about securing food and shelter; it is also about protecting the mind from spiraling into the depths of despair. Here, music can provide a crucial psychological buffer . To sustain courage in battle, soldiers are often seen singing, while, in the conflict zones , civilians use it to ward off fear and grief. Singing together builds communal strength, which allows people to endure situations where isolation could be fatal. The therapeutic aspect of music has long been documented, and this has particular importance in wars. During World War I , soldiers used to sing folk songs and patriotic tunes in the trenches. It was to cope with the anxiety and the constant presence of death that they felt. Even in recent conflicts, such application persists, but, of course, it has expanded beyond morale-building. Refugee camps frequently organize concerts and workshops, recognizing that melodies can provide children and adults alike with an emotional release that words cannot. Defiance Through Melody: The Case of Palestine In the past couple of years, the Israel-Palestine  conflict has become way more violent than before. In occupied Palestine , music has been seen to evolve into a crucial tool of survival and resistance. Musicians face censorship, arrests, and even violence for their performances, yet they continue to sing because silence would be surrender. Palestinian hip-hop groups like DAM use rap as a platform to voice political anger, narrating stories of checkpoints, house demolitions, and everyday humiliation under occupation. on the other hand, folk traditions such as “ dabke ”and old songs serve to remind communities of their roots and collective strength. Even the lullabies sung to children in Gaza are not merely bedtime songs about fairies and princesses but messages and promises of a fateful day of freedom and survival: “We are still here, and we will survive.” In Palestine , music is about existence. Every lyric and beat becomes an act of defiance against cultural erasure and ethnic cleansing. Music on the Frontlines: Ukraine’s Sonic Resistance Since gaining independence, Ukraine has increasingly aligned itself with the West , and to maintain influence on Ukraine, Russia  was prepared to go to any length. Thus, what followed was the Russian invasion in 2022 . This war in Ukraine has revealed to us how music functions both on the battlefield and in besieged cities. Ukrainian musicians have turned to folk traditions, national anthems, and modern rock as rallying cries. One of the prominent examples is the band Kalush Orchestra and their Eurovision-winning  song “ Stefania .” This song became sort of a symbol of resilience. Originally written as a tribute to the singer’s mother, it became one of the national anthems of survival. It was broadcast across many Ukrainian shelters and camps to unite soldiers and civilians. Ukrainian soldiers also record battlefield songs on their phones; these recordings circulate online and play an important role in shaping how the world perceives the war, apart from boosting morale at the front. Preserving Heritage Amid Displacement: Syrian Refugee Musicians The Syrian revolution  in March 2011  began with the people’s discontent with the Ba'athist  regime ruled by Bashar al-Assad . It triggered large-scale protests and turned into the Syrian Civil War . This Civil War , like all the others, has displaced millions, and it is considered one of the largest refugee crises of the modern era. Amid the chaos, those who became the custodians of endangered heritage were Syrian musicians. In refugee camps, groups of displaced artists used their traditional instruments, such as oud, qanun , and darbuka , and recorded albums in makeshift studios. To maintain the essence of the music of their country, they blended traditional Syrian melodies with modern influences. It was their way of keeping the cultural identity alive in exile. Many musical projects were undertaken during this crisis. One of them was the Syrian Expat Philharmonic Orchestra . This project proved that music has the power to recreate a community after being displaced. Composed of professional musicians from all across Europe , the orchestra performed Syrian compositions, and their audiences were the Syrian refugees. The Voice of the Forgotten: Sahrawi Underground Bands The Sahrawi people are an African ethnic group native to the western part of the Sahara Desert . The Sahrawi culture is a mix of Arab and African elements. Since they live far from the media spotlight, when the Sahrawi people were displaced from Western Sahara  by decades of conflict, the world paid no attention. But, to keep their struggle alive, the Sahrawis had music at their disposal. In refugee camps of Algeria , underground Sahrawi bands perform protest songs. These songs were edgy, quirky, and strangely traditional. One of the most prominent groups would be “ Tiris ”. They incorporated traditional Sahrawi poetry with modern sounds, which reflected both exile and resistance. In the harsh environment of desert camps, music functions as both a political voice and a survival mechanism. Music as a Universal Language of Survival Be that in Palestine, Ukraine, Syria, or the Sahara , it is clear as day that songs are the perfect preserver of identity under threat, keep track of stories at risk of being erased, and create rare moments of humanity. When words are censored and silence becomes intolerable, music screams. It goes beyond linguistic and cultural boundaries, and allows suffering to be shared and resilience to be amplified. Beyond survival, music can serve as a form of historical archive as well. In war zones where documentation is impossible, songs carry both mundane and historical moments for future generations to inherit. Epilogue Wars have been the agent of destruction. All it can do is to annihilate what we have built for millennia—both tangible and spiritual. Meanwhile, music stands in stark contrast to wars. Music is the agent of creation. It creates a spiritual landscape where we can flourish into our true selves. So, it does not come as a surprise when we see from all conflicts that music is a natural resistance to destruction. From innocent lullabies to underground concerts, music in war zones is always more than art. In every conflict, music makes us endure when the world is falling apart; with every note and every beat, it gives us the reason to stay together, refusing silence.",0,"en",2025-08-29T16:00:28Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""1yt0z316"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""IMAGE"",""id"":""mp3cv407"",""nodes"":[],""imageData"":{""containerData"":{""width"":{""size"":""CONTENT""},""alignment"":""CENTER"",""textWrap"":true},""image"":{""src"":{""id"":""ef9da7_9977470899d24d18a607006309bdfd69~mv2.png""},""width"":1280,""height"":720},""link"":{""url"":""https://youtu.be/vFTIXaPW9T8"",""target"":""BLANK"",""rel"":{""noreferrer"":true}}}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""cae30410"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""7hsb0439"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""o4id7448"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""When bombs fall and borders collapse and the separation between life and death is nothing but a thin line, what often emerges as a lifeline is music.
